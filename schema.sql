Text by Christiaan De Beukelaer and Jennifer Corcoran. Photographs by Christiaan De Beukelaer.</p><p>//</p><p>'In the Stillness Between Two Waves of the Sea'<br>Christiaan De Beukelaer & Jennifer Corcoran</p><p>Imagine you’re at sea. Surrounded only by water. Swept by the wind.</p><p>This is the space to which we are confined. Fifteen crew aboard the <em>Avontuur</em>. At present, we are anchored off Veracruz, Mexico. Unable to go ashore due to port closures, we will not set foot on land until we return to Hamburg in Germany, where the vessel is flagged. This could be sometime in June or July. If all goes well.</p><p>We are isolated from the world. But we are not alone. We could go anywhere. But we would not be allowed ashore.</p><p>We have been <a href="https://timbercoast.com/en/shiptracker/">at sea for a long time</a>: Jennifer joined the ship in its home port of Elsfleth, Germany at the start of January. She intended to disembark at Marie Galante in the French Antilles after two months. Christiaan boarded in Santa Cruz de Tenerife in the Canaries at the end of February to make the three-week Atlantic crossing and disembark in Marie Galante as well.</p><p>The <em>Avontuur</em> is a hundred-year-old, 44-metres long, two-masted schooner. She is operated by the German shipping company <a href="https://timbercoast.com/en/">Timbercoast</a>. This enterprise, founded by Cornelius Bockermann, sails with a mission: <a href="https://theconversation.com/plain-sailing-how-traditional-methods-could-deliver-zero-emission-shipping-97180">reducing emissions from maritime cargo transport to zero</a>.</p><p>We are here to support this mission, but the voyage has gained greater meaning due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Now confined to life at sea, we are wondering why we’re here beyond the cargo run we’re completing.</p><p>The world we’ve left is no longer the same. We sailed from the Canaries just after Carnival. No curfew hampered the festivities of one of the world’s largest carnival celebrations. They stretched throughout the city of Santa Cruz for days. Costumed people danced and drank, hugging in the streets. Social distancing didn’t exist.</p><p>We have not been on land since we left Santa Cruz on March 1st.</p><p>Since then, we took on a cargo of coffee in Puerto Cortés, Honduras and cacao in Belize. Here in Veracruz, Mexico we have taken on more coffee. None of these ports permit shore leave, let alone crew change. Repatriation has not been permitted.</p><p>We have no curfew. But we are confined to our ship. We have travelled to these places. But we have only <em>been</em> at sea.</p><p>Countries are in lockdown. Borders are closed. But the sea has no borders that can be closed.</p><p>We do not hear warnings or news of infection rates and casualties. No television reports. No rumours. Our communications beyond the ship are limited to when we’re close to land, beyond the occasional email from the shipowner over a very expensive satellite connection. With no Internet, we are disconnected from the world when at sea.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic feels about as real as the formation of new stars in faraway galaxies. We can imagine the noise on land about the COVID-19 pandemic must be deafening. But we hear no such thing.</p><p>What we hear is something quite else. We hear a constant cadence of wind and water surrounding the ship. These sounds never stop, but they’re not intrusive. There is no silence, but no noise either.</p><p>The sole exception is our diesel generator. It runs from time to time to top up the solar and wind-powered navigational equipment and water-maker. Much like the hum of the city or the twitter of social media, you only realise how intrusive it is once it stops.</p><p>It may stretch one’s imagination to understand the life we live aboard.</p><p>The weather is an unpredictable force to be reckoned with. The wind can be forceful, fair, or absent. The sun can be so strong that every cloud and night hour is sheer bliss. Squalls come and go with little warning, especially at night. And the swells can throw us about relentlessly. “Weather is neither good nor bad,” says our captain. “It just is.” And we learn to read it, to anticipate.</p><p>We live in close quarters. The fo’c’s’le, an open space below deck at the bow of the ship, houses 10 low bunks. We share one seawater pump toilet and a single sink. There is no hot water. We take seawater bucket showers and wash our laundry in a bucket on deck. Fortunately, we have a well-provisioned galley for great cooking and bread baking.</p><p>We sleep with the sound of the sea against the sides of the bow. By now, we can guess the speed of the hull with reasonable accuracy by merely listening to the wake.</p><p>Sharing our common confinement with fifteen aboard is intense. We’ve only known each other for months. But it feels like we’ve already had years of friendships. And tensions.</p><p>Social life aboard follows clock time very rigidly. Our days and nights are punctuated by a watch system. The crew is divided into a three-watch system of four hours each. Which means we’re four on, eight off. Every twelve hours. Each day. Without respite.</p><p>While we move freely through the water, we are constrained by the force and direction of the wind.</p><p>Life ashore, in contrast, seems to have gone mad. People have been, so we hear, locked up in their own homes. The winds and swell are undeterred by curfews.</p><p>In our sea-bound confinement, we are learning to listen and begin to understand the interplay of water and wind. By listening to these sounds – patiently – we start to realise why we’re here.</p><p>We are beginning to take on a different pace, a different rhythm that may help us to slow down collectively.</p><p>The sea is a vast open space the imagination can bathe in. While confined to life on water for the foreseeable future, we have turned to tuning in to subtle changes. Far from the noise of social media, we are listening in to the sea around us, more deeply into ourselves, and to each other. And it feels as though we are starting to remember to listen.</p><p>Like sailing, listening takes time. But perhaps we can begin to hear beyond the human-only conversation. And in listening, maybe we can engage in the most subtle, but most powerful, form of social engagement: letting go of the noise to show that living a simple life <em>with</em> our natural world is possible.</p><p><a href="https://christiaan.debeukelaer.net/">Christiaan De Beukelaer</a> is a senior lecturer at the University of Melbourne.<br>Jennifer Corcoran is an Irish film director.</p>	Courtesy of Christiaan De Beukelaer & Jennifer Corcoran	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Other	\N	1	0	0	https://www.instagram.com/sailcargoresearch/	\N	CC BY-NC-ND	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

The film is a cinematic inquiry that focuses on the daily labour of caring for endangered beings to resuscitate them from their imminent human-induced extinction. The technology of the ad hoc laboratory; scientific knowledge; the complexity of marine ecologies; and the intimacy of providing care converge in the precision of sustaining coral IVF. Whilst keeping the coral in captivity is, dishearteningly, the fundamental condition of Jamie Craggs’ research, the scientists and the coral also become entangled in sharing a space for living, working and world-making, expanding the range of possible worlds in common.

These giant circular ocean currents collect and contain plastic from around the world. Plastic Reef grew in size parallel to the increasing exposure and awareness that was slowly awakening. Every time the work was exhibited it became bigger as more and more plastic was added. In total more than 1000kg of plastic debris was fished out between 2008 and 2013. In 2015 scientists discovered that natural coral was ingesting micro-plastics, poisoning itself in the process. Next to acidification and water temperature rising, this is one of the main reasons for the disappearance of the Great Barrier Reef.

The workshop focused on the appropriation of the topic 'Phenomenal Ocean' through texts, body work, art, discussions, and meetings with different protagonists, activists, and artists on site. Followed by 'The Current II,' Convening #2, a day of ideas for a new ocean language in response to the 'IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate,' presented by TBA21–Academy. Led by Chus Martínez, Expedition Leader of 'The Current II,' the second of three annual Convenings exploring the theme 'Spheric Ocean.'\n\nThe Summer School and the Convening were both located at Ocean Space in Venice, a venue that has as its primordial aim to enhance—through a dialogue between art, science, advocacy, and activism—the process and the demands of becoming Earth. \n\nTo this process belongs not only action and a sense of urgency, but also philosophy, art, and defining culture, so that it encompasses scientific thinking and analysis, political thought, community concerns, and justice in all its complex forms.\n\nParticipants of the Public Events: 'The Current II' Convening #2: 'Phenomenal Ocean' were: \nCarsten Aniksdal, Julieta Aranda, Amanda Coulson, DIS (Marco Roso), Elena Mazzi, Skye Morét, Francesca Mussi, Katrin Niedermeier, Ingo Niermann, Markus Reymann, Tabita Rezaire, Marzia Rovere, Teresa Solar, Alexander Tarakhovsky, Lena Maria Thüring, Francesca Thyssen-Bornemisza, Khadija von Zinnenburg Carroll, with a special contribution by Niño de Elche\nModerated by Chus Martínez\n\nParticipants of the Summer School #2 at the Ocean Space were: \nHamza Amleh, Vela Arbutina, Céline Maria Brunko, Nadien Cueni, Damien Juillard, Leah Joséphine Nehmert, Jacob Ott, Diogo Pinto (Art Institute, Basel); Sonia Barbey, Mattia Bussola, María Valeria Biondo (A plus A, The School for Curatorial Studies, Venice)\n\nThe Summer School was mentored by Thomas Lempertz, Teresa Solar, Lena Maria Thüring, María Montero Sierra, and Marion Ritzmann.\n\nWith the special participation of Jane da Mosto, Fabio Cavallari, Angela Pomaro (ISMAR), and Microclima.\n\nProduction: Art Institute and TBA21–Academy\nAuthor of connecting text: Ingo Niermann\nSpeaker: Bettina Wiehler\nSound track: Sound from 'All Bleeding Stops Eventually,' A series of six videos created by Will Benedict, produced by DIS.ART and commissioned by TBA21–Academy \nResearch team Art Institute: Marion Ritzmann, Alice Wilke\nProducer and Program Coordinator TBA21–Academy: María Montero Sierra \nEditing and Sound design: Elena Zieser\nTechnical Support and Recording: Esther Hunziker, TBA21-Academy, Phoenix, Marion Ritzmann, María Montero Sierra\nPress and communication Art Institute: Anna Francke \nGraphic design: Ana Domínguez Studio	Courtesy of Art Institute HGK FHNW and TBA21–Academy	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Other	\N	1	0	1	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/15	\N	CC BY-NC	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	f	f	\N

Deep sea mining will occur mainly in areas rich in polymetallic nodules, in seamounts, and in hydrothermal vents. Mining companies are already leasing areas in national and international waters in order to extract minerals and metals such as manganese, cobalt, gold, copper, iron, and other rare earth elements from the seabed. Main sites targeted for future exploration are the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the Clarion Clipperton Zone (Pacific Ocean) in international waters, as well as the islands of Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Tonga, New Zealand, Japan, and the Portuguese Azores archipelago. Yet, potential impacts on deep sea ecosystems are yet to be assessed by the scientific community, and local communities are not being consulted.\n\nThe prospects of this new, experimental form of mining are re-actualizing a colonial, frontier mentality and redefining extractivist economies for the twenty-first century. This web series addresses different issues related to this process, from ocean governance by international bodies to knowledge of the deep, following the lines proposed by the United Nations for a shift towards a "blue economy," but also efforts to defend sustained ocean literacy about the deep ocean, when its species and resources remain largely unmapped and unstudied.\n\n'What is Deep Sea Mining?' is a TBA21–Academy commission developed by Inhabitants (Mariana Silva and Pedro Neves Marques), an online channel for exploratory video and documentary reporting, in collaboration with Margarida Mendes, curator and activist from Lisbon, Portugal, and founding member of Oceano Livre environmental movement against deep sea mining.

A film created by Khadija von Zinnenburg Carroll, with Jody Toroa, for TBA21–Academy’s ‘The Current II’ Convening ‘Phenomenal Ocean’ featuring the launch of the Ocean Archive, led by Chus Martínez.\n\nCommissioned by TBA21–Academy, von Zinnenburg Carroll’s film addresses the conflict at the core of the environmental crisis. On the one hand, life, like the whale in the film, is dying because of pollution. On the other, people of the ocean – like the Maori community featured in this film – have agency in turning these tragedies into cultural life, finding a way of moving forward by honouring the dead and campaigning for a better political future.\n\nThe death of the whale leads people in the small village of Muriwai that it beached in to relearn the customary ways of removing her bones and curing them to make Taonga – cultural treasures – that in turn tell the history of their relationships. While her flesh is too toxic to be consumed as it was when the Pacific Ocean was cleaner, her soft bones can be used to fertilize Kauri trees that are dying. The whale thereby lives on in the healthy trees and carvings on the tribal meeting house, which keeps oral histories alive in contemporary art.\n\nThe video was made with the Rangiwaho community in Aotearoa/New Zealand during a time when their material culture was returned to them for the first time after being looted in the scientific raid of Captain Cook in 1769. It is in the context of this political agency that the whale is a sign, that from the tragic legacy of colonialism, new Taonga can be made.

The report finds that strongly reducing greenhouse gas emissions, protecting and restoring ecosystems, and carefully managing the use of natural resources would make it possible to preserve the ocean and cryosphere as a source of opportunities that support adaptation to future changes, limit risks to livelihoods and offer multiple additional societal benefits.\n\nThe 'SROCC' provides the best available scientific knowledge to empower governments and communities to take action, embedding that scientific knowledge on unavoidable change and plausible futures into their own context, to limit the scale of risks and climate impacts.\n\nThe report gives evidence of the benefits of combining scientific with local and indigenous knowledge to develop suitable options to manage climate change risks and enhance resilience.

Il neologismo "Nowtilus" si riferisce a 'Nautilus', il sottomarino immaginario capitanato da Nemo nei romanzi di Jules Verne "Ventimila leghe sotto i mari" (1870). Il termine indica anche un mollusco cefalopodo sopravvissuto relativamente senza alcun cambiamento per 450 milioni di anni e, in costante crescita durante la sua esistenza, è diventato un simbolo di espansione e rinnovamento. Inoltre, Nautilus è una parola latina termine che definisce semplicemente il marinaio. Il suffisso "Now" (ora, in italiano) ne connota l'urgenza nel tempo presente e la necessità di una riflessione a partire dai cambiamenti ambientali che la laguna sta subendo in maniera esponenzialmente accelerata nel nostro 21esimo secolo.</p>\n<p>Chi salirà a bordo del "Nowtilus" verrà portato ad ascoltare visioni e storie straordinarie di ordinari abitanti di Venezia e professionisti di settore, mappando le ricerche scientifiche lagunari; le visioni architettoniche e urbanistiche della città; i cambiamenti delle acque dei canali e le verità sotto la superficie delle plastiche e microplastiche; ma anche le ricerche di artisti che attentamente hanno osservato i flussi di interazione umana peculiare a Venezia; le realtà culturali indipendenti che negli anni sono emerse e che si battono per una Venezia critica e creativa; racconti sulla pesca tradizionale e sulle sue derive industriali e la divulgazione di comportamenti sostenibili in merito alla cucina locale. La serie presenta una ricerca anfibia su Venezia, gli sguardi esistenti all'interno del suo ecosistema lagunare, al suo rapporto con l'acqua, alla navigazione, agli scambi culturali. Una riflessione che parte anche dalla sua precarietà contemporanea, dall'acqua alta e dall'erosione della città, dallo spopolamento, dagli aerei che atterrano all'aeroporto Marco Polo. Come ristabilire il delicato equilibrio tra uomo e natura nella città che per eccellenza riflette il rapporto tra l'uomo e il mare, il turismo di massa e la resilienza della città? Ripensare come può essere Venezia - se è il suo ecosistema ad essere posto al centro delle nostre preoccupazioni e non alla periferia - è quello che "Nowtilus" vuole scoprire.</p><p>Episodi condotti da Enrico Bettinello e curati insieme ad Alice Ongaro Sartori.Musiche tratte dall’album “Venice” (2004) del compositore e musicista austriaco Christian Fennesz.</p><p>'TBA21-Academy Radio' è una trasmissione che si immerge in conversazioni sull'arte, la cultura, l'immaginazione e la comunità, oltre che nel suono di storie oceaniche di relazioni umane, e non.

'Nowtilus: Stories from an urban lagoon in the 21st century' is a programme of research and investigation into voices revealing a Venice that is, first and foremost, a lagoon in relation to the existence of its inhabitants. Over the course of eight podcast episodes shared on Ocean Archive and on TBA21−Academy Radio Soundcloud every two weeks starting April 24th 2020, 'Nowtilus' will take listeners on a journey of discovery and dialogue between different stories related to the sustainability of the lagoon, the city's resilience and the reversal of generalities and trivialisations about one of the most unique and at the same time popularised city in the world: Venice.</p><p>The neologism "Nowtilus" refers to "Nautilus," captain Nemo's submarine in Jules Verne's novel "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas" (1870). The term also denominates a cephalopod mollusc that has survived unchanged for 450 million years. Furthermore, Nautilus is also the Latin word for sailor, derived from the Greek nautilos. The prefix "now" suggests the current urgency to reflect on the state of Venice and its lagoon.</p><p>Those boarding the “Nowtilus” will discover extraordinary visions and stories of Venetian inhabitants and professionals, who will map: lagoon-specific, scientific research on tides and high water; architectural and urban visions, changes in the waters of the canals; realities under a surface of plastics and micro-plastics; visions of Venetian artists and their careful observations of the peculiar dynamics of human interaction in Venice; independent cultural realities that have emerged over the years and are fighting for a critical and liveable Venice; stories about traditional fishing practices and the industrialisation of fishing and the local food supply-chain. The series presents an amphibious research project about Venice, the views existing within its lagoon ecosystem, and the city’s relationship with water, navigation and cultural exchange. How to restore the delicate balance between humanity and nature in the city and its lagoon that provide a quintessential reflection of the relationship between humans and their surrounding environment, mass tourism and the resilience of a city? Rethinking what Venice can be - if its lagoon can be placed at the centre of our concerns and not at the periphery - is what "Nowtilus" seeks to discover.</p><p>Episodes conducted by Enrico Bettinello and curated with Alice Ongaro Sartori. Music from the album “Venice” (2004) by Austrian composer and musician Christian Fennesz.</p><p>'TBA21–Academy Radio' is a broadcast channel diving into conversations about art, culture, imagination and community, as well as music curated around the oceanic stories of human and non-human collaborations.

To capture the diversity of vibrant life that she saw during her seasonal work with the US Antarctic Program, artist Skye Morét compared colour pixels from 100 photographs taken above and below the waves of the Antarctic Peninsula. Fifty upper bars represent images captured of the land and seascape above the sea surface, while fifty lower bars exemplify the vibrant and varied world beneath the waves. The juxtaposition of colour and intensity exposes our assumptions of a ‘colourless’ Antarctica and reveals a surprising realm below — one that tends to be neglected in popular dialogue about a quickly warming Antarctic Peninsula. In that light, it is the artist’s hope that experiential media can engender a rich cultural consciousness and connection to Antarctica, a continent most people will never experience and can barely conceive.

It seems almost impossible for Westerners to move away from imperatives to “rescue” or the impulse to “develop”. It is for this reason that we look for exceptionality: what makes the Solomon Islands so special? What happened there that may be of importance to others? What can we learn from them? These questions, even if legitimate, indicate our incredible will to outsource, to discover the “special” trait of the place and “use” it in another context, our context. The Colombian anthropologist <a href="https://g.co/kgs/nNtYvE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Astrid Ulloa</a> wrote a great book on the way Western culture invented the ecological native. Western culture is influenced by the logic of Modernity and Colonialism, by the global impulses rising wildly again after 1989, and “them”, the ecological subjects who are in touch with the true meaning of life we left behind. Closer to plants and nature and their resources, they are poor and exploited but truer to the messages life sends them through the animals and plants, through the seas and the rays of the sun… This all leaves us with a very important question: What are the elements that define and explain the different worlds that coexist in ours? And how are we capable of creating conditions for these human and nonhuman agents, epistemes, intelligences, myths to produce a language and a <a href="https://g.co/kgs/YWFT2H" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paideias</a>, that is many methods for learning how to transform our behaviour so that we alter positively the course of our relation with the Ocean. And this means not another educational wave trying to impose notions and values on others, but a readiness to listen and adapt, to experience with the creatures and the humans so that we can free ourselves from the artificial imposition of human values and beliefs onto nature. In the sense the Ocean names not only its reality, but it contains so many other questions: how does the Ocean relate to the experiences of gender simultaneously informed by class, ethnicity, race…? We are viewing the necessary resurgence of the term “intersectionality”, and the need to describe the ways in which oppressive institutions (racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, xenophobia, classism, etc.) are interconnected and cannot be examined separately from one another: How to create a situation where Earth and Ocean questions come together? This is the task and the exercise is to imagine a method to convey and portray human relations with nonhuman species so that we will not only create but support many new scenarios on coexistence, on an education nourished by many transmission codes, where ideas and experiences from art and science take the form of scenarios and possibilities of future politics.</p><p>The first European to set foot on the Islands was a Spaniard looking for gold, therefore they are called Solomon in the hope the Islands would host the gold that made the biblical king a master of the world. And our group, what are we looking for? To figure out the methods, to find ways of conveying how utopian imagination is trapped in a one-way future based on the capitalist and industrialist belief in growth. Every intervention to counteract this logic counts. That’s the new gold.&rsquo;</p><p>– Chus Martínez</p>	\N	1	0	0	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Chus Martínez and TBA21–Academy	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	{2280,1282}	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/34	\N	\N	f	\N

The anthology is a part of '<a href="https://ensayostierradelfuego.net/ensayos/ensayo-4/">Ensayo#4</a>,' which is an interdisciplinary project that began in 2015 and deals with management, language, values and identity related to the ocean and the coast in certain parts of Norway and Chile. The book got its name from Section 2 of the Norwegian Marine Resources Act. What can laws and management tell us about the relationships we have to nature and to our surroundings? The aim of the project 'The Wild Living Marine Resources Belong to Society as a Whole' is to learn more about our management of the natural resources and our fundamental views on nature through looking at a legislative text. We want to see the text and our relationships to nature in new ways, and from both critical, poetical and speculative points of view. In this way the project is about awareness, knowledge, poetry and community. Today, in our complex world, we constantly become more alienated and removed from nature and from how society and our use of resources function. Therefore we think that both knowledge, emotions and poetry can be necessary tools in order to reactivate both rational and emotional relationships to our surroundings, and thus to ourselves. Because if we do not have the ability to see how our lives relate to larger structures in society and to natural cycles it is also difficult to imagine other possible communities, social structures, and lives in and with nature.</p>	\N	1	0	0	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Randi Nygård and Karolin Tampere / The Wild Living Marine Resources Belong to Society as a Whole	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/18	\N	\N	t	\N

This drawing was created by Eduardo Navarro on the fourth day of Chus Martínez’s expedition ‘Spheric Ocean: To Find the Vegan Lion.’\n\nThe expedition took place in March 2018 on board the M/Y Dardanella as part of TBA21–Academy’s ‘The Current II’ fellowship programme. The journey set the space to feel and think differently about the oceans, springing from the urge to reunite thinkers and artists to start a new school of sensing intelligence while exploring the questions: Is the Ocean an art space? Or a future space within the arts? How many waves are in the Ocean? What can we ask the ocean?	\N	1	0	0	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	graphite and pastel on A4 printer paper	29.7 x 21 cm	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Eduardo Navarro and TBA21–Academy	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	{2477,3486}	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/5	\N	\N	t	\N

Episode 1: Tools for Ocean Literacy	\N	\N	'What is Deep Sea Mining? Episode 1: Tools for Ocean Literacy' is a cartographical survey of technologies that have contributed to ocean literacy and seabed mapping. Structured around a single shot along a vertical axis, the episode inquires about deep sea mining and the types of geologic formations where it is set to occur, particularly hydrothermal vents. Understanding the process of deep sea mining demands not only a temporal investigation – its main dates, legal and corporate landmarks, and scientific breakthroughs – but also a spatial axis connecting the seafloor to outer space cartographic technologies. After all, we know less about the ocean depths than about the universe beyond this blue planet.\n\n'What is Deep Sea Mining?' is a TBA21–Academy commission developed by Inhabitants (Mariana Silva and Pedro Neves Marques), an online channel for exploratory video and documentary reporting, in collaboration with Margarida Mendes, curator and activist from Lisbon, Portugal, and founding member of Oceano Livre environmental movement against deep sea mining.

This study takes up the widely discussed concept of limiting global mean temperature to a certain target value, like the so-called 2 °C target, to assess the related impacts on the Swiss Alpine glaciers. A model setup is introduced that uses and combines homogenized long-term meteorological observations and three ensembles of transient gridded Regional Climate Model simulations to drive a distributed glacier mass balance model under a (regionalized) global 2 °C target scenario. 101 glaciers are analyzed representing about 50% of the glacierized area and 75% of the ice volume in Switzerland. In our study, the warming over Switzerland, which corresponds to the global 2 °C target is met around 2030, 2045 and 2055 (depending on the ensemble) for Switzerland, and all glaciers have fully adjusted to the new climate conditions at around 2150. By this time and relative to the year 2000, the glacierized area and volume are both decreased to about 35% and 20%, respectively, and glacier-based runoff is reduced by about 70%.</p>	\N	0	0	1	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of the author(s)	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Environmental Research Letters	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/7/4/044001	\N	\N	t	\N

In this study, we report on glacier elevation and mass changes in the outer region of the Northern and Southern Patagonian Icefields in the Southern Patagonian Andes. A newly-compiled Landsat ETM+ derived glacier inventory (consisting of 2253 glaciers and ~1314 ± 66 km2 of ice area) and differencing of the SRTM and SPOT5 DEMs were used to derive glacier-specific elevation changes over the 2000–12 period. The investigated glaciers showed a volume change of −0.71 ± 0.55 km3 a−1, yielding a surface lowering of 0.52 ± 0.35 m a−1 on average and an overall mass loss of 0.46 ± 0.37 m w.e. a−1. Highly variable individual glacier responses were observed and interestingly, they were less negative than previously reported for the neighboring Patagonian Icefields.</p>	\N	0	0	1	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of the author(s)	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Journal of Glaciology	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-glaciology/article/mass-changes-of-alpine-glaciers-at-the-eastern-margin-of-the-northern-and-southern-patagonian-icefields-between-2000-and-2012/72D28EFACC78F6B8866D4B4AE069FBC2	\N	\N	t	\N

PCAI’s educational platform was developed by Polyeco Contemporary Art Initiative (PCAI) in 2017 to raise environmental awareness through the medium of moving image and to challenge our perceptions about the realities we live in. The programs are especially designed to address environmentally sensitive issues through the medium of digital art whereas children have the opportunity to comprehend critical, ecological issues that affect their places of residence. The final outcome of each program is a short film, part of PCAI’s digital art heritage, forming an ecological, short film collection made by children for children.\n\nAnimator: Babis Alexiadis\nScriptwriter: Eleni Svyrou Svyriadi\nIllustrator: Sofia Vlazaki\nProduction Manager: Kika Kyriakakou\nJunior Animators: Hoor حور, Renad رناد, Aysha عائشة, Reem ريم, Meera ميرة, Tayma تيماء, Retal رتال, Shefa شفاء, Atheer ثير, Maram مرام, Ammar عمار, Mohammed Suliman محمد سليمان, Mohammed Abdullah محمد عبدالله, Ali علي, Hassan حسان, Khalid خالد, Hasan حسن, Bshar بشار, Majid ماجد, Abdullah عبدالله\n\nProduced by PCAI in partnership with Orpic, Polyeco Gulf and the North Al Batinah Directorate General of Education in Oman.	\N	1	0	0	\N	\N	AR	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Animated video	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Polyeco Contemporary Art Initiative (PCAI)	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N

On the one hand we are sensitive to all living creatures, on the other, we are willing to sacrifice that ideological attachment and appreciation to sustain our appetites, desires, and material wants. Joan Jonas's exhibition 'Moving Off the Land II' considers no such ambiguity. She has replaced the notion of anthropocentric hegemony with Timothy Morton's "ecological thought." Morton proposes a way of viewing and living in the world (around, under and above us) where there is respect and connection to all living things, even of those creatures he calls "strange strangers" who we will never fully know.  He calls our universe, which has no boundaries, "the entangling mesh" which can be horrific or strange, tender or loving.  'Moving Off the Land II' doesn't just give standing to the nonhuman. It is an epic portrayal of intelligent life beneath the sea and a dreamy drama of our potential symbioses with other species.\n\nWhen compared with other eco art at the 2019 Venice Biennale, Jonas's large-scale installation was one of the few that evoked a palpable sense of purpose, vitality, and connection with the global ecological crisis and how it effects biodiversity. Her video, sculpture, drawing, and sound works, deconstructed from her ongoing Moving Off the Land performance, provides a "Gesamtkunstwerk" which transports the viewer into an alternate liquid world inhabited by the "other." This essay reveals how the artist accomplishes the daunting task of making us care deeply about the fragility, feelings, necessity, dependencies, and potential extinction of sea life. It also confirms the emotional affect of the work by publishing selected viewer comments from the Ocean Space guestbook.	\N	1	0	0	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Cynthia Haveson Veloric	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N

As of 2020, the archive includes contributions from Anvers Island (Antarctica), Cape Verde, Cuba, Greenland, Kivalina (Alaska), Miami, Nepal, New Orleans, New York City, Panama, Peru, Russia, Senegal, Trinidad and Tobago, and Tuvalu. Together, through common but differentiated collections, these contributions form an archive of what will have been. This project stems from ‘The Wild Living Marine Resources Belong to Society as a Whole’ (2017), an anthology of works helping us to understand, express and manage environmental issues in new and better ways.</p>	\N	1	0	0	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of ­­­­­­Amy Balkin / The Wild Living Marine Resources Belong to Society as a Whole	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/18	\N	\N	t	\N

In the last 30 years, the Mediterranean scientific community developed an observing and forecasting capacity on the basis of best practices in monitoring and modeling. Now, the Mediterranean multi-platform observing and forecasting system, constituting the European and national contribution to the GOOS, can serve as the starting basis to achieve the Decade goals. During the Decade the lack of sustained in situ observations for several Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs), particularly biological variable and gaps in observation on Central-Eastern Mediterranean and on the Northern African coasts, should be filled. The opportunity to extend the range of observables from space should be exploited as well as the synergy between space and in situ observation and new technology and methodologies should be expended to improve predictive capabilities of ecosystems state and functions. The Mediterranean Sea could be a laboratory for Early Warning Observations and predictive capabilities for the assessment of the impacts of climate change and multi-stressors on the marine ecosystem and in the coastal environment. In the multi-cultural context and the geo-political diversity of Mediterranean countries, to promote and implement regional cooperation, and develop capacity building and ocean literacy programs will play crucial. During the Decade, we will promote the collaboration among science community, UNEP/MAP Barcelona Convention, the BlueMed Initiative and national policy makers in order to address policy requirements and contribute to UN SDGs.</p>	\N	0	1	1	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	{UNESCO-IOC}	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	The UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development 2021-2030: Mediterranean Workshop ‘The Mediterranean Sea We Need for the Future We Want’	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/21	\N	\N	t	\N

Although inhabited for 6 millennia Socotra only began to open up to the outside world in 1990. With conservation interventions starting prior to major developments, and building on centuries-old low-intensity resource management, Socotra has been in a unique position to practice pre-emptive conservation. In 1997 modern conservation started with biodiversity and socio-economic surveys, with inputs from communities and decision makers, which fed into the Conser- vation Zoning Plan. Approved in 2000, this has been the archipelago's principal conservation planning and manage- ment tool. Regulations and bans on fishing practices, the collection of coral stones and export of biological materials have all been relatively well complied with by local communi- ties and authorities. Inappropriate road construction, however, driven by non-islanders, has demonstrated the limits of the Conservation Zoning Plan, highlighting significant institu- tional challenges in planning and coordination. The capacity of the Socotra-based conservation institution has increased dramatically over the last decade. Its personnel are generally respected, largely because their roles include assisting local communities with development initiatives, underlining the importance of integrating conse rvation and development at the onset of conservation. Although the integrity of the landscape will inevitably decline, especially along the northern coastline, Socotri conservationists, backed by international support, are in a unique position to shape the archipelago's future.></p>	\N	0	0	1	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of the author(s)	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N

Trade winds play a pivotal role in understanding the European expansion and its impact in current geopolitical configurations.\n\nThis drawing is a result of a re-interpretation of F.

It deals with the urgent business of marine oil spills. The video's fictional script is loosely based on interviews with Theodosis Alifrangis, the longest-serving employee of Environmental Protection Engineering S.A. The two screen work features an eclectic sample of Alifrangis' prolific VHS archive, filmed over 40 years, alongside imagery created in Olde Wolbers' studio, where model sets of cruise ship interiors, ferromagnetic mussels and molecular structures are covered in oil paints and filmed in tanks. It also features sonar imaging of the unsalvageable Sea Diamond, a cruise ship in Santorini that has commanded Alifrangis' daily care for the last 10 years.	\N	1	0	0	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Polyeco Contemporary Art Initiative (PCAI)	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	{4724,1462}	https://www.pcai.gr/collection/work-in-progress/	\N	\N	t	\N

This photograph was taken by Julieta Aranda on the eighth day of Chus Martínez's expedition 'Spheric Ocean: To Find the Vegan Lion.'\n\nThe expedition took place in March 2018 on board the M/Y Dardanella as part of TBA21–Academy's 'The Current II' fellowship programme. The journey set the space to feel and think differently about the oceans, springing from the urge to reunite thinkers and artists to start a new school of sensing intelligence while exploring the questions: Is the Ocean an art space? Or a future space within the arts? How many waves are in the Ocean? What can we ask the ocean?	\N	1	0	0	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	digital photograph		\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Julieta Aranda and TBA21–Academy	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	{3024,4032}	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/5	\N	\N	t	\N

The journey set the space to feel and think differently about the oceans, springing from the urge to reunite thinkers and artists to start a new school of sensing intelligence while exploring the questions: Is the Ocean an art space? Or a future space within the arts? How many waves are in the Ocean? What can we ask the ocean?	\N	1	0	0	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	marker and watercolour on paper	29.7 x 21 cm	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Teresa Solar and TBA21–Academy	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	{1124,1548}	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/5	\N	\N	t	\N

Disproportionately higher risks are expected in the course of the 21st century. Reinforcing the findings of the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C, vulnerable human communities, especially those in coral reef environments and polar regions, may exceed adaptation limits well before the end of this century and even in a low greenhouse gas emission pathway (high confidence). Depending on the effectiveness of 21st century mitigation and adaptation pathways under all emission scenarios, most of the low-lying regions around the world may face adaptation limits beyond 2100, due to the long-term commitment of sea level rise (medium confidence).\n\nThe IPCC 'Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate' (SROCC), approved on 24 September 2019 by the 195 IPCC member governments, provides evidence for the benefits of limiting global warming to the lowest possible level – in line with the goal that governments set themselves in the 2015 Paris Agreement. The report finds that strongly reducing greenhouse gas emissions, protecting and restoring ecosystems, and carefully managing the use of natural resources would make it possible to preserve the ocean and cryosphere as a source of opportunities that support adaptation to future changes, limit risks to livelihoods and offer multiple additional societal benefits.\n\nThe 'SROCC' provides the best available scientific knowledge to empower governments and communities to take action, embedding that scientific knowledge on unavoidable change and plausible futures into their own context, to limit the scale of risks and climate impacts.\n\nThe report gives evidence of the benefits of combining scientific with local and indigenous knowledge to develop suitable options to manage climate change risks and enhance resilience. This is the first IPCC report that highlights the importance of education to enhance climate change, ocean and cryosphere literacy.	\N	0	0	1	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	{"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)"}	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/35	\N	\N	t	\N

The island underwent long geological and political isolation, ensuring preservation of unique ecosystems until the start of the new millennium. Now, Socotra Island is undergoing rapid development, out of balance with conservation. Major causes for biodiversity loss in other global insular ecosystems such as habitat fragmentation and degradation, pollution, invasive species and the impact of tourism, are becoming pressing issues that deserve close attention. Unsustainable resource use, the loss of traditional land management and illegal trade in biota are worrying phenomena that further increase the pressures on Socotra’s ecosystems. We provide the first comprehensive review of potential human impacts on Socotra before the 21st century, an updated discussion of some of the principal threats to its biodiversity in recent times, discussing local examples within a historical context of known extinction processes on islands, and underline the importance of traditional knowledge in the protection of Socotran ecosystems.</p>	\N	0	0	1	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of the author(s)	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Zoology in the Middle East	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09397140.2011.10648899?scroll=top&needAccess=true	\N	\N	t	\N

Concurrently, it assesses the local, regional and global consequences and impacts of individual and interacting polar system changes, and it assesses response options to reduce risk and build resilience in the polar regions. \n\nThe IPCC 'Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate' (SROCC), approved on 24 September 2019 by the 195 IPCC member governments, provides evidence for the benefits of limiting global warming to the lowest possible level – in line with the goal that governments set themselves in the 2015 Paris Agreement. The report finds that strongly reducing greenhouse gas emissions, protecting and restoring ecosystems, and carefully managing the use of natural resources would make it possible to preserve the ocean and cryosphere as a source of opportunities that support adaptation to future changes, limit risks to livelihoods and offer multiple additional societal benefits.\n\nThe 'SROCC' provides the best available scientific knowledge to empower governments and communities to take action, embedding that scientific knowledge on unavoidable change and plausible futures into their own context, to limit the scale of risks and climate impacts.\n\nThe report gives evidence of the benefits of combining scientific with local and indigenous knowledge to develop suitable options to manage climate change risks and enhance resilience. This is the first IPCC report that highlights the importance of education to enhance climate change, ocean and cryosphere literacy.	\N	0	0	1	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/35	\N	\N	t	\N

Predicting specific future conditions and assessing the best management strategies to maintain ecosystem integrity and sustainable resource use are difficult, because of multiple interacting pressures, uncertain projections, and a lack of test cases for management. We argue that the Baltic Sea can serve as a time machine to study consequences and mitigation of future coastal perturbations, due to its unique combination of an early history of multistressor disturbance and ecosystem deterioration and early implementation of cross-border environmental management to address these problems. The Baltic Sea also stands out in providing a strong scientific foundation and accessibility to long-term data series that provide a unique opportunity to assess the efficacy of management actions to address the breakdown of ecosystem functions. Trend reversals such as the return of top predators, recovering fish stocks, and reduced input of nutrient and harmful substances could be achieved only by implementing an international, cooperative governance structure transcending its complex multistate policy setting, with integrated management of watershed and sea. The Baltic Sea also demonstrates how rapidly progressing global pressures, particularly warming of Baltic waters and the surrounding catchment area, can offset the efficacy of current management approaches. This situation calls for management that is (i) conservative to provide a buffer against regionally unmanageable global perturbations, (ii) adaptive to react to new management challenges, and, ultimately, (iii) multisectorial and integrative to address conflicts associated with economic trade-offs.</p>	\N	0	0	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of the author(s)	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Science Advances	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/5/eaar8195	\N	\N	t	\N

These giant circular ocean currents collect and contain plastic from around the world. Plastic Reef grew in size parallel to the increasing exposure and awareness that was slowly awakening. Every time the work was exhibited it became bigger as more and more plastic was added. In total more than 1000kg of plastic debris was fished out between 2008 and 2013. In 2015 scientists discovered that natural coral was ingesting micro-plastics, poisoning itself in the process. Next to acidification and water temperature rising, this is one of the main reasons for the disappearance of the Great Barrier Reef.	\N	1	1	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	melted plastic debris from the world's oceans	variable	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of the artist and Meessen De Clercq Gallery, Brussels	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	{3543,2657}	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/17	\N	\N	t	\N

Here, we present a quantitative assessment of the effects of human actions on the floor of the tidal channels from the Venice Lagoon using 2500 kilometres of full coverage multibeam bathymetric mapping. Such extended dataset provides unprecedented evidence of pervasive human impacts, which extend far beyond the well known shrinking of salt marshes and artificial modifications of inlet geometries. Direct and indirect human imprints include dredging marks and fast-growing scours around anthropogenic structures built to protect the historical city of Venice from flooding. In addition, we document multiple effects of ship traffic (propeller-wash erosion, keel ploughing) and diffuse littering on the sea-floor. Particularly relevant, in view of the ongoing interventions on the lagoon morphology, is the evidence of the rapid morphological changes affecting the sea-floor and threatening the stability of anthropogenic structures.</p>	\N	0	0	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of the author(s)	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Nature: Scientific Reports	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-43027-7	\N	\N	t	\N

One of the tasks was the extraction of otoliths pairs from farmed salmons; unique crystals or bio-minerals that serve as a chemical diary of a fish. This seeded a reflection on how the microscopic crystals of the film material arrange themselves under a photochemical process.\n\nThis outline aims to translate the techno-antiseptic Cartesian environment constructed for a captive salmon through a grainy, imperfect 16mm film aesthetic. It is accompanied by an extract from a conversation with Sámi artist Ánde Somby in Tromsø, 2019.\n\n'The Bonding' will be produced thanks to the support from KORO and first premiered at Kunsthall 3,14, Bergen, Norway.\n\nConcept: Michelle-Marie Letelier\nDirector of Photography: Carlos Vasquez\nProduction and Editing: Carlos Vasquez & Michelle-Marie Letelier\nPost-production: Muscle Temple Lab	\N	1	0	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	16mm film transferred to HD	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Michelle-Marie Letelier	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	{1035,690}	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/36	\N	\N	t	\N

The journey set the space to feel and think differently about the oceans, springing from the urge to reunite thinkers and artists to start a new school of sensing intelligence while exploring the questions: Is the Ocean an art space? Or a future space within the arts? How many waves are in the Ocean? What can we ask the ocean?	\N	1	0	0	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	digital photograph	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Claudia Comte and TBA21–Academy	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	{2947,2947}	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/5	\N	01070000A0E6100000010000000101000080203F7D406FEF6540B514413A003742C06602E0E7BE27823F	t	\N

This is a response to several factors leading to increasing land lowering (subsidence) of the northern delta and adjacent seafloor, plus an accelerating rise in eustatic (world) sea level in the Mediterranean. An average eustatic sea-level rise of ~3 mm/yr represents only ~26% to 45% of total relative sea-level rise measured along this margin. Three factors leading to subsidence are neotectonic lowering, compaction of Holocene sequences, and diminished sediment replenishment by much reduced Nile flow to Egypt’s coast. Subsidence accounts for variable average land lowering of ~3.7 mm/yr of section in the NW delta, ~7.7 mm/yr in the N delta, and ~8.4 mm/yr in the NE delta, based on compaction rates of strata thicknesses that decrease down-core between top and base of Holocene sections in 85 drill cores distributed along the delta margin. Among present critical challenges are marked reduction of Nile water and sediment below the High Aswan Dam that can now reach the delta coast. It is expected that problems of fresh water and energy poverty in the lower Nile Basin are likely to be seriously exacerbated in years ahead by construction of Ethiopia’s Grand Renaissance Dam (GERD). Completion of this, the biggest hydroelectric structure in Africa, is this year. Egypt, the Sudan, and Ethiopia must resolve the looming crisis of diminished Blue Nile water and sediment distribution to the lower Nile Basin and Egypt’s delta margin.</p>	\N	0	0	1	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of the author(s)	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	GSA Today	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://www.geosociety.org/gsatoday/archive/27/5/article/GSATG312A.1.htm	\N	\N	t	\N

One of the tasks was the extraction of otoliths pairs from farmed salmons; unique crystals or bio-minerals that serve as a chemical diary of a fish. This seeded a reflection on how the microscopic crystals of the film material arrange themselves under a photochemical process.\n\nThis outline aims to translate the techno-antiseptic Cartesian environment constructed for a captive salmon through a grainy, imperfect 16mm film aesthetic. It is accompanied by an extract from a conversation with Sámi artist Ánde Somby in Tromsø, 2019.\n\n'The Bonding' will be produced thanks to the support from KORO and first premiered at Kunsthall 3,14, Bergen, Norway.\n\nConcept: Michelle-Marie Letelier\nDirector of Photography: Carlos Vasquez\nProduction and Editing: Carlos Vasquez & Michelle-Marie Letelier\nPost-production: Muscle Temple Lab	\N	1	0	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	16mm film transferred to HD	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Michelle-Marie Letelier	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	{1035,690}	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/36	\N	\N	t	\N

The video includes the following excerpts from the programme:\n\n00:00:00\n‘The Ways to Awe!, Part II.’ \nChus Martínez\n\nThe second part to a “manifesto” by expedition leader Chus Martínez. In this lecture, Martínez begins by asking the question, “What are we doing here?” as a way to highlight the multiple answers that embrace togetherness through the transferring of intelligence.\n\n00:22:27\n‘Merging With The Depths!’ \nDiva J. Amon\n\nA lecture by Dr Diva J. Amon split into the ‘Ohs’ and ‘Ahs’ to tie in with the theme of the convening. The Ohs: despite that over 99% of the deep ocean is unexplored, humankind’s use is rapidly increasing, resulting in little-understood impacts on the communities and functions of the deep sea. This is compounded by the deep ocean remaining out of sight and out of mind due to little communication with the public, policymakers and other stakeholders, in large part because the deep sea is out of reach to people of colour and nationals of developing countries. The Ahs: Globally, technology is increasing, and slowly, humans are democratising deep-sea exploration, science and science communication. Telepresence and low-cost technologies are allowing many subsets of the global population that previously did not have access to the deep sea in order to be part of the conversation.\n\n01:03:28 \n‘Three Proposals of Understanding All We Need to Change in Us to Become the Sea’ \nJulieta Aranda, Chus Martínez, Ingo Niermann\n\nA conversation led by the expedition leader and two of the expedition participants discussing how the complexities of environmental narratives inform their artistic production and the human process at large.\n\n01:26:10\n‘Everybody Got a Little Voice to Address the Seas’\nChristina Samoka Eu Tony, Reverend Rogers\n\nThis lecture by Christina Samoka Eu Tony and Reverend Rogers provides an insight into the journey of resistance of deep-sea mining in Papua New Guinea. The talk touches on the experimental state of seabed mining technology and the impacts it has on the health of the environment and the country’s population at large.	\N	1	1	1	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of the participant(s) and TBA21–Academy	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	The Waves of the Oh!s and the Ah!s	\N	\N	\N	Ocean Space, Church of San Lorenzo, Venice, Italy	{"Diva Amon","Julieta Aranda","Chus Martínez","Ingo Niermann","Reverend Rogers","Christina Samoka Eu Tony"}	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/2	\N	\N	t	\N

These giant circular ocean currents collect and contain plastic from around the world. Plastic Reef grew in size parallel to the increasing exposure and awareness that was slowly awakening. Every time the work was exhibited it became bigger as more and more plastic was added. In total more than 1000kg of plastic debris was fished out between 2008 and 2013. In 2015 scientists discovered that natural coral was ingesting micro-plastics, poisoning itself in the process. Next to acidification and water temperature rising, this is one of the main reasons for the disappearance of the Great Barrier Reef.	\N	1	1	1	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of the artist and Meessen De Clercq Gallery, Brussels	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Plastic Reef	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/17	\N	\N	t	\N

Dams impede the flow of essential nutrients, including carbon, phosphorus, nitrogen and silicon, along river networks, leading to enhanced nutrient transformation and elimination. Increased nutrient retention via sedimentation or gaseous elimination in dammed reservoirs influences downstream terrestrial and coastal environments. Reservoirs can also become hotspots for greenhouse gas emission, potentially impacting how ‘green’ hydropower is compared with fossil-fuel burning. In this Review, we discuss how damming changes nutrient biogeochemistry along river networks, as well as its broader environmental consequences. The influences of construction and management practices on nutrient elimination, the emission of greenhouse gases and potential remobilization of legacy nutrients are also examined. We further consider how regulating hydraulic residence time and environmental flows (or e-flows) can be used in planning and operation from dam conception to deconstruction.</p>	\N	0	0	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of the author(s)	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Nature Reviews Earth & Environment	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-019-0019-0	\N	\N	t	\N

The report finds that strongly reducing greenhouse gas emissions, protecting and restoring ecosystems, and carefully managing the use of natural resources would make it possible to preserve the ocean and cryosphere as a source of opportunities that support adaptation to future changes, limit risks to livelihoods and offer multiple additional societal benefits.\n\nSROCC provides the best available scientific knowledge to empower governments and communities to take action, embedding that scientific knowledge on unavoidable change and plausible futures into their own context, to limit the scale of risks and climate impacts.\n\nThe report gives evidence of the benefits of combining scientific with local and indigenous knowledge to develop suitable options to manage climate change risks and enhance resilience. This is the first IPCC report that highlights the importance of education to enhance climate change, ocean and cryosphere literacy.	\N	0	0	1	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	{"Courtesy of The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)"}	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/35	\N	\N	t	\N

Aennor considers how nurturing solidarity, togetherness and the new shared values can become the motivation for us all. \n\nThe material was filmed in Okayama, Miyajima, Yakushima and Okinawa, Japan.\n\nTranscript:\n\nWe can learn a lot about resilience, communal co-existence and vitality from the ocean and the nature around us.\n\nAs other species are dependent on one another in the endless spiral of life, so we are. Re-evaluating its dependency and trust in each other is more important than ever. \n\nPerhaps, it's the moment to redefine our beliefs and to nurture the new shared values. In the time of closed borders and the imposed restrictions, which became the new reality so suddenly, we should aim to find closeness and connection, no matter how physically distanced we are: whether in introspection, though art, talking to and caring about each other. \n\nEven if the frontiers are closed, the voices can't be the silenced. \n\nWe are all equally responsible for using this momentum: for shifting to a slower pace, for finding the ways to externalise our feelings and frustrations, for stepping beyond our egos and for relating to imagination outside our own subjectivity. \n\nWe are a part of the whole, connected to the complex breathing apparatus of the planet Earth, and we have to make every possible effort to keep it functioning. Nature, and its survival force, is there to bring us back together, and we shouldn’t forget to listen to it and to the ecosystems around. \n\nIt's through the mutual promise of care we can find solidarity and encouragement. 	\N	1	1	1	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	9:16 digital video	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Aennor	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N

Red Sea reef dwellers are adapted in a very warm environment, fact that makes them vulnerable to further and rapid warming. The detection and understanding of abrupt temperature changes is an important task, as ecosystems have more chances to adapt in a slowly rather than in a rapid changing environment. Using satellite derived sea surface and ground based air temperatures, it is shown that the Red Sea is going through an intense warming initiated in the mid‐90s, with evidence for an abrupt increase after 1994 (0.7°C difference pre and post the shift). The air temperature is found to be a key parameter that influences the Red Sea marine temperature. The comparisons with Northern Hemisphere temperatures revealed that the observed warming is part of global climate change trends. The hitherto results also raise additional questions regarding other broader climatic impacts over the area.</p>	\N	0	0	1	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of the author(s)	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Geophysical Research Letters	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2011GL047984	\N	\N	t	\N

This quantity is comparable to the positive vertical bias of the principle digital elevation model (DEM) used to assess global and national population exposures to extreme coastal water levels, NASA’s SRTM. CoastalDEM is a new DEM utilizing neural networks to reduce SRTM error. Here we show – employing CoastalDEM—that 190 M people (150–250 M, 90% CI) currently occupy global land below projected high tide lines for 2100 under low carbon emissions, up from 110 M today, for a median increase of 80 M. These figures triple SRTM-based values. Under high emissions, CoastalDEM indicates up to 630 M people live on land below projected annual flood levels for 2100, and up to 340 M for mid-century, versus roughly 250 M at present. We estimate one billion people now occupy land less than 10 m above current high tide lines, including 230 M below 1 m.</p>	\N	0	0	1	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of the author(s)	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Nature Communications	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12808-z	\N	\N	t	\N

At the same time, they are more densely populated than the hinterland and exhibit higher rates of population growth and urbanisation. As this trend is expected to continue into the future, we investigate how coastal populations will be affected by such impacts at global and regional scales by the years 2030 and 2060. Starting from baseline population estimates for the year 2000, we assess future population change in the low-elevation coastal zone and trends in exposure to 100-year coastal floods based on four different sea-level and socio-economic scenarios. Our method accounts for differential growth of coastal areas against the land-locked hinterland and for trends of urbanisation and expansive urban growth, as currently observed, but does not explicitly consider possible displacement or out-migration due to factors such as sea-level rise. We combine spatially explicit estimates of the baseline population with demographic data in order to derive scenario-driven projections of coastal population development. Our scenarios show that the number of people living in the low-elevation coastal zone, as well as the number of people exposed to flooding from 1-in-100 year storm surge events, is highest in Asia. China, India, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Viet Nam are estimated to have the highest total coastal population exposure in the baseline year and this ranking is expected to remain largely unchanged in the future. However, Africa is expected to experience the highest rates of population growth and urbanisation in the coastal zone, particularly in Egypt and sub-Saharan countries in Western and Eastern Africa. The results highlight countries and regions with a high degree of exposure to coastal flooding and help identifying regions where policies and adaptive planning for building resilient coastal communities are not only desirable but essential. Furthermore, we identify needs for further research and scope for improvement in this kind of scenario-based exposure analysis.</p>	\N	0	0	1	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of the author(s)	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	PLOS ONE	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0118571#sec014	\N	\N	t	\N

When the two hazards interact, the resulting impact can be worse than when they occur individually. Both storm surges and heavy precipitation, as well as their interplay, are likely to change in response to global warming. Despite the CF relevance, a comprehensive hazard assessment beyond individual locations is missing, and no studies have examined CF in the future. Analyzing co-occurring high sea level and heavy precipitation in Europe, we show that the Mediterranean coasts are experiencing the highest CF probability in the present. However, future climate projections show emerging high CF probability along parts of the northern European coast. In several European regions, CF should be considered as a potential hazard aggravating the risk caused by mean sea level rise in the future.</p>	\N	0	0	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of the author(s)	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Science Advances	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/9/eaaw5531	\N	\N	t	\N

We will also be talking about this, forms of sharing and inviting many to participate in thinking; the role education plays, how online media may be turned into hubs for sharing ideas, arguments, artworks, facts and writing of communities otherwise apart just because of the nature of culture today, the logic of disciplinary thinking. With the help of <a href="http://dis.art" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DIS</a>, we produced a movie and a setting in the space to introduce all those questions, to host our guests, and to welcome you.</p><p>The motive of the day: to think how the language that presents us with separate worlds of interests and realms creates a barrier to reflect on the fact that we are all living in the same defenceless planet.’</p><p>– Chus Martínez</p>	\N	1	0	0	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Chus Martínez and TBA21–Academy	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	{2280,1282}	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/15	\N	\N	f	\N

The sound was projected alongside the following excerpt from Francesca Thyssen-Bornemisza's lecture-performance 'Sounds Too Many':\n\n"The question I would like to raise here: Why do we even continue to search for oil, further and further out to sea? Where supply ships and services become more and more expensive, at the continued cost to life and ecosystems. As the world moves closer to renewable energy, this becomes an even bigger question to ask. One very good sign of progress was the recent decision by the Norwegian government to protect the breeding grounds of cod and orca from oil exploration around the Lofoten islands, and this is an important sign of change!

These people, unlike their counterparts who are still in Libya, are free to talk about their experiences without fear of retribution The report has two purposes. First, it is intended to hold Libyan authorities accountable for their mistreatment of migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers. It therefore seeks to improve the deplorable conditions of detention in Libya and to encourage Libya to establish asylum procedures in conformity with international refugee standards. Secondly, this report is intended to hold the Italian government, the European Union (EU), and its external borders migration control agency, Frontex, accountable for any harm that befalls people who are returned to Libya without an assessment of their protection needs. It therefore is also intended to convince EU institutions and member states to stop Italy and Frontex from forcibly returning migrants to Libya where they are routinely subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment and where potential refugees are not effectively protected.></p>	\N	0	1	0	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	{"Human Rights Watch"}	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Human Rights Watch	\N	\N	\N	\N	1-56432-537-7	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://www.hrw.org/report/2009/09/21/pushed-back-pushed-around/italys-forced-return-boat-migrants-and-asylum-seekers	\N	\N	t	\N

What do we lack? How do we learn? What is a body, and what is a body of water? In <em>How to Move Like the Ocean (Liquefaction, Lubrication &amp; Expansion in Twelve Easy Steps)</em> (2020), the dancer and choreographer Temitope Ajose-Cutting passes through the rooms of her London apartment and then out into the seemingly emptied world, moving to (and against) spectral instructions that offer her the chance to become liquid, become ocean, become, that is, everything. Those instructions, written and read by the writer Quinn Latimer, offer some salty pedagogical drift, equal parts lesson and poetry, political current and personal query, as they sequence loss, levity, desire, kinship, kelp beds, and some tantalizing blue drink. Wet with the genres of both realism and speculative fiction, <em>How to Move Like the Ocean</em> reveals the depths that the imaginary of the body, ever slippery, can go.</p><p>Performance and Recording: Temitope Ajose-Cutting<br>Script and Voiceover: Quinn Latimer<br>Editing: Iris Touliatou</p><p>Commissioned by TBA21–Academy with the support of Institut Kunst HGK FHNW in Basel</p>	\N	1	0	0	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	HD video, colour, sound, 11:56 min	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Temitope Ajose-Cutting, Quinn Latimer and TBA21–Academy	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N

The sound was projected alongside the following excerpt from Francesca Thyssen-Bornemisza's lecture-performance 'Sounds Too Many':\n\n"I am of course talking about nuclear and hydrogen bomb testing in the Pacific, by the United States, Britain, and France. Between them they detonated 438 bombs over a period of 50 years in the oceans (1946–1996) which apart from having a devastating impact on wildlife, placed an unimaginable toll on the human inhabitants of those atolls. Public outrage was finally heard in the early 1970s, but it took ages for the international test ban treaty to be implemented in 1996."\n\n'Sounds Too Many' is an immersive lecture-performance that places the ocean at center stage at a time when sound pollution is exploding by using sophisticated audio engineering and visualizations to put things into perspective. Thyssen-Bornemisza's lecture brings into question the unlimited and unregulated sonic pollution that the Anthropocene era has imposed on the ocean and the disruption it causes natural phenomena. \n\nThe soundscapes were produced by Ears Up Sound Design and the lecture-performance was commissioned by TBA21–Academy.	\N	1	0	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	{"Francesca Thyssen-Bornemisza"}	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Francesca Thyssen-Bornemisza and TBA21–Academy	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/31	\N	\N	t	\N

The imagined research paper was part of an installation of various sketches and specimens in the 2016 exhibition ‘Reset Modernity!’ at the ZKM Center for Art and Media in Karlsruhe, Germany.\n\nAbstract:\nFlattened impressions from the Great Crisis Stratum, of a type previously interpreted as artefactions (‘indeterminate tuboids’), synthesized by the extinct, short-lived civilization of that era, are here re-interpreted as organic petrifactions. Using specimens collected from a new rock exposure by the Crystal River, we suggest that their location in life, offshore from a storm-swept coastline, their variable morphology on flattening, and the lack of an obvious synthetic crushing mechanism in this setting argues against an artefactional origin. Rather, we suggest that they may represent an aberrant species of organism of unknown affinity, perhaps evolved in response to the extreme selection pressures of those times. We here name it Brunaspis enigmatica, and suggest that its irregular deformation is the result of predation by shell-crushing ray-fish, teeth of which have been found in the same stratum.	\N	1	0	1	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Anne-Sophie Milon and Jan Zalasiewicz	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Society of Ancient Phenomena	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/7	\N	\N	t	\N

Rome engaged a patient strategy of "mending" with the two main national actors and with a plethora of local players, tribes, municipalities, city-states, and militias struggling in the quest for power. For Italy, a stable Libya is crucial to manage the flow of migrants leaving the country and crossing the Strait of Sicily, to ensure energy provisions, and to manage licit and illicit economic activities in the Mediterranean. Trying to assess the resilience of this strategy is of the utmost importance in order to have a measure of which kind of responsibility Rome assumed over the past two years and what kind of accountability would be inherited by the incoming government. Indeed, the "molecular" approach carried out by the Gentiloni Government in the country should be viewed as a double-edged strategy; while the migration flow dramatically shrank over the past months, economic relations recover and informal cooperation forges new spaces for dialogue, promoting ambiguous players, without a comprehensive approach and a clear political vision, could undermine prospects for peace in the country, Italian national interests and the future of Italy-Libya relations.</p>	\N	0	1	0	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Aldo Liga and Institut français des relations internationales (IFRI)	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://www.ifri.org/en/publications/etudes-de-lifri/playing-molecules-italian-approach-libya	\N	\N	t	\N

The report finds that strongly reducing greenhouse gas emissions, protecting and restoring ecosystems, and carefully managing the use of natural resources would make it possible to preserve the ocean and cryosphere as a source of opportunities that support adaptation to future changes, limit risks to livelihoods and offer multiple additional societal benefits.\n\nThe 'SROCC' provides the best available scientific knowledge to empower governments and communities to take action, embedding that scientific knowledge on unavoidable change and plausible futures into their own context, to limit the scale of risks and climate impacts.\n\nThe report gives evidence of the benefits of combining scientific with local and indigenous knowledge to develop suitable options to manage climate change risks and enhance resilience. This is the first IPCC report that highlights the importance of education to enhance climate change, ocean and cryosphere literacy.	\N	0	0	1	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	{"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)"}	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/35	\N	\N	t	\N

The project included various sketches, specimens and an imagined research paper in the form of an installation as part of the 2016 exhibition ‘Reset Modernity!’ at the ZKM Center for Art and Media in Karlsruhe, Germany.	\N	1	0	1	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	mixed media	147 x 88 cm	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Anne-Sophie Milon and Jan Zalasiewicz	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	{2177,3074}	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/7	\N	\N	t	\N

Still, its liquidity and enormous size sustain substantial differences. The oceans slip away from national and personal liability. The video 'Sea Lovers' portrays a group of people who train for a more intimate relation with the ocean. They try to learn to enjoy not just the cute and the intelligent but also the gloomy and the uncanny. By means of exercise and technology, they work towards a sea of love where all creatures help and celebrate each other. 'Sea Lovers' is written and directed by Ingo Niermann, filmed and edited by Roman Bayarri, and features Ana María Millán and the fellows of the TBA21-Academy expedition #2, Cycle 2 'The Solomon Exercises,' led by Chus Martínez. The score has been created by producer Ville Haimala and the singers Franziska Aigner and Dan Bodan.\n\nThe film was commissioned by TBA21–Academy.	\N	1	0	0	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Ingo Niermann and TBA21–Academy	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	http://www.ocean-archive.org/collection/34	\N	\N	t	\N

Captured through a light microscope, 'Reclaiming Vision' features a diverse cast of microorganisms, sampled from the brackish waters of the inner Oslo Fjord, alongside algae, cultivated at the University of Oslo. The film reveals various processes in the water that are hidden to the naked human eye. By investigating the brackish water, its inhabitants, its properties, and the traces left by human activities, the film is a reflection upon the relationship we humans have with our surroundings, especially through what we cannot see.	\N	1	0	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Marjolijn Dijkman and Toril Johannessen	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	{3000,1687}	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/10	\N	\N	t	\N

Nonetheless, benthic communities in this region remain poorly known. The ABYSSLINE Project is conducting benthic biological baseline surveys for the UK Seabed Resources Ltd. exploration contract area (UK-1) in the CCZ. Using a Remotely Operated Vehicle, we surveyed megafauna at four sites within a 900 km² stratum in the UK-1 contract area, and at a site ~250 km east of the UK-1 area, allowing us to make the first estimates of abundance and diversity. We distinguished 170 morphotypes within the UK-1 contract area but species-richness estimators suggest this could be as high as 229. Megafaunal abundance averaged 1.48 ind. m–². Seven of 12 collected metazoan species were new to science, and four belonged to new genera. Approximately half of the morphotypes occurred only on polymetallic nodules. There were weak, but statistically significant, positive correlations between megafaunal and nodule abundance. Eastern-CCZ megafaunal diversity is high relative to two abyssal datasets from other regions, however comparisons with CCZ and DISCOL datasets are problematic given the lack of standardised methods and taxonomy. We postulate that CCZ megafaunal diversity is driven in part by habitat heterogeneity.	\N	0	1	1	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Diva J.

We know that humans are bad at being faithful, infidelity has a tenacity that faithfulness can only envy. If you ask about Nature or the Ocean, everyone would be ready to declare their love or dependency, and yet we cheat on the seas, on water, on resources, on the images, on life. Ocean Adultery has many forms, and historically it has been—as Anthony Burgess describes it—"the most creative of sins." We deplore the many times and many ways we were unfaithful to the Ocean, and yet prohibition only fuels the eagerness with which we consume our forbidden apples—or better said, our forbidden waters, fish, corals, sea beds, and human lives…. We need to face this: If we keep failing to meet our own standards, the solution is simply to try harder. This exercise cannot happen without thinking through a question: Who is the injured party? One would say the Ocean, but would that be to demonize our actions without pausing to explore our motives? Without learning how to weather its occurrence?</p><p>Inspired by the history of fear, power abuse and its relation to the elements rather than only to the humans, and drawing on the thinking of many poets, writers, and philosophers about the importance of the complaint to raise awareness, the first day of our convening will be structured as a lament: a collective performance where activists and artists give body, form, and voice to what we lament. Lamenting the Ocean, but also current forms of inequality, considering how gender and racial inequality are in complete entanglement here.</p><p>On the second day, the lamenting voice will raise an Awe. Admiration, reverence, a series of acts, performances, and lectures on the issues we admire, on all in life that bring us to this strange space of generosity, since to admire means to go out of oneself.’</p><p>– Chus Martínez</p>	\N	1	0	0	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Chus Martínez and TBA21–Academy	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	{2280,1282}	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/2	\N	\N	f	\N

The essay illustrates the industrial machine as the forgotten bifurcation of energy and information and follows such a bifurcation along three stages: the industrial factory, the cybernetic society, and planetary computation. More generally, the essay tries to recombine the energy theory of labor (labor as manual and energetic activity) with the information theory of labor, that is, labor as a source of information and intelligence that gives form to energy. The notions of carbosilicon machine and cyberfossil capital are sketched in order to rethink social autonomy also as autonomy of energy and information.</p>	\N	0	0	1	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Matteo Pasquinelli	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	The South Atlantic Quarterly	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	http://matteopasquinelli.com/automaton-anthropocene/	\N	\N	t	\N

On the one hand, life, like the whale in the film, is dying because of pollution. On the other, people of the ocean – like the Maori community featured in this film – have agency in turning these tragedies into cultural life, finding a way of moving forward by honouring the dead and campaigning for a better political future.\n\nThe death of the whale leads people in the small village of Muriwai that it beached in to relearn the customary ways of removing her bones and curing them to make Taonga – cultural treasures – that in turn tell the history of their relationships. While her flesh is too toxic to be consumed as it was when the Pacific Ocean was cleaner, her soft bones can be used to fertilize Kauri trees that are dying. The whale thereby lives on in the healthy trees and carvings on the tribal meeting house, which keeps oral histories alive in contemporary art.\n\nThe video was made with the Rangiwaho community in Aotearoa/New Zealand during a time when their material culture was returned to them for the first time after being looted in the scientific raid of Captain Cook in 1769. It is in the context of this political agency that the whale is a sign, that from the tragic legacy of colonialism, new Taonga can be made. This is part of healing the colonial wound, and it is the wounds deep on Te Haa Kui o Tangaroa’s body that the viewer witnesses as Jody Toroa tells her story.	\N	1	1	0	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Ocean Space, Church of San Lorenzo, Venice, Italy	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Khadija von Zinnenburg Carroll and TBA21–Academy	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/15	\N	\N	t	\N

Anderson Barbata's performative piece embodies her first-hand experiences and research into ancient wisdom whilst on expedition in Papua New Guinea with TBA21–Academy. The resulting work combines spoken word, dance, improvisation, stilt dancing, ritual, procession, costuming and music to create a unique form of storied performance that unfolded in the plaza of the United Nations, New York.\n\n‘Ocean Calling’ is inspired by all forms of life that make the ocean their home, as well as by the people, the histories and the cosmography of the communities that for millennia have lived in close relationship with the ocean. The work unfolds in an urban environment highly dependent on the health of the oceans, even though it may not be overtly obvious to our urban communities. ‘Ocean Calling’ invited audiences to first acknowledge our intersecting identities and then, to celebrate and honor them by changing behaviors to protect our oceans.\n \nThe work also highlights the importance of the Declaration signed by Pacific Island Countries and Territories to significantly improve Ocean governance, which was drafted during the Pacific Regional Platform for Partnerships and Action on Sustainable Development Goal 14 (SDG14) meeting, which took place in 2017 in Suva, Fiji.\n \n‘Ocean Calling’ was developed in collaboration with artists from Mexico, Jamaica and the Caribbean diaspora. The first iteration of ‘Ocean Calling’ was presented in Jamaica as ‘What-Lives-Beneath’ in 2016 for TBA21–Academy’s ‘The Current I’ Convening ‘The Kula Ring’ led by Ute Meta Bauer.	\N	1	1	0	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	performance	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Laura Anderson Barbata and TBA21–Academy	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	http://www.tba21oceanweek.org/oc	\N	\N	t	\N

Every time the work was exhibited it became bigger as more and more plastic was added. In total more than 1000kg of plastic debris was fished out between 2008 and 2013. In 2015 scientists discovered that natural coral was ingesting micro-plastics, poisoning itself in the process. Next to acidification and water temperature rising, this is one of the main reasons for the disappearance of the Great Barrier Reef.	\N	1	1	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of the artist and Meessen De Clercq Gallery, Brussels	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	{2480,1654}	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/17	\N	\N	t	\N

The sound was projected alongside the following excerpt from Francesca Thyssen-Bornemisza's lecture-performance 'Sounds Too Many':\n\n"Roger Payne, a much-revered whale researcher, released the first ever album of humpback whale songs in the 1970’s. The record was an immediate sensation, selling hundreds of thousands of copies, and eventually going multi platinum. Back then, whale songs joined a long list of iconic albums released by groups such as the Beatles, Grateful Dead, Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, Neil Young, Santana and many more legends...This album probably saved the whales from certain extinction as it bolstered a huge public outcry to save the whales!" \n\n'Sounds Too Many' is an immersive lecture-performance that places the ocean at center stage at a time when sound pollution is exploding by using sophisticated audio engineering and visualizations to put things into perspective. Thyssen-Bornemisza's lecture brings into question the unlimited and unregulated sonic pollution that the Anthropocene era has imposed on the ocean and the disruption it causes natural phenomena. \n\nThe soundscapes were produced by Ears Up Sound Design and the lecture-performance was commissioned by TBA21–Academy.	\N	1	0	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	{"Francesca Thyssen-Bornemisza"}	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Francesca Thyssen-Bornemisza and TBA21–Academy	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/31	\N	\N	t	\N

Widespread cryosphere changes affect physical, biological and human systems in the mountains and surrounding lowlands, with impacts evident even in the ocean. Building on the IPCC's '5th Assessment Report' (AR5), this chapter assesses new evidence on observed recent and projected changes in the mountain cryosphere as well as associated impacts, risks and adaptation measures related to natural and human systems. Impacts in response to climate changes independently of changes in the cryosphere are not assessed in this chapter.

This is the first IPCC report that highlights the importance of education to enhance climate change, ocean and cryosphere literacy.	\N	0	0	1	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	{"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)"}	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/35	\N	\N	t	\N

Anderson Barbata's performative piece embodies her first-hand experiences and research into ancient wisdom whilst on expedition in Papua New Guinea with TBA21–Academy. The resulting work combines spoken word, dance, improvisation, stilt dancing, ritual, procession, costuming and music to create a unique form of storied performance that unfolded in the plaza of the United Nations, New York.\n \n‘Ocean Calling’ is inspired by all forms of life that make the ocean their home, as well as by the people, the histories and the cosmography of the communities that for millennia have lived in close relationship with the ocean. The work unfolds in an urban environment highly dependent on the health of the oceans, even though it may not be overtly obvious to our urban communities. ‘Ocean Calling’ invited audiences to first acknowledge our intersecting identities and then, to celebrate and honor them by changing behaviors to protect our oceans.\n \nThe work also highlights the importance of the Declaration signed by Pacific Island Countries and Territories to significantly improve Ocean governance, which was drafted during the Pacific Regional Platform for Partnerships and Action on Sustainable Development Goal 14 (SDG14) meeting, which took place in 2017 in Suva, Fiji.\n\n‘Ocean Calling’ was developed in collaboration with artists from Mexico, Jamaica and the Caribbean diaspora. The first iteration of ‘Ocean Calling’ was presented in Jamaica as ‘What-Lives-Beneath’ in 2016 for TBA21–Academy’s ‘The Current I’ Convening ‘The Kula Ring’ led by Ute Meta Bauer.	\N	1	1	0	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	performance	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Laura Anderson Barbata and TBA21–Academy	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	http://www.tba21oceanweek.org/oc	\N	\N	t	\N

The film reveals various processes in the water that are hidden to the naked human eye. By investigating the brackish water, its inhabitants, its properties, and the traces left by human activities, the film is a reflection upon the relationship we humans have with our surroundings, especially through what we cannot see.	\N	1	0	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Marjolijn Dijkman and Toril Johannessen	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	{3000,1687}	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/10	\N	\N	t	\N

The video includes the following excerpts from the programme:\n\n00:00:00 \n‘Welcome’\nMarkus Reymann & Francesca Thyssen-Bornemisza\n\nAn introduction to the Convening’s programme by Chairwoman and Founder of Thyssen-Bornemisza Art Contemporary (TBA21), Francesca Thyssen-Bornemisza and Director of TBA21–Academy, Markus Reymann. The introduction includes a historical account of the Church of San Lorenzo and the process of restoring it into the Ocean Space, a global center for catalyzing ocean literacy, research, and advocacy through the art.\n\n00:21:00 \n‘The Ohhhs! The Ways to Complain, Part I’ \nChus Martínez\n\nAn introductory “manifesto” given by expedition leader Chus Martínez. In this lecture, Martínez speaks about the concept of an “archway,” likening the idea to the ocean being a shared public space, which directly impacts humans and the ways they transform it. \n\n00:29:32\n‘Sex and the Seas or How We Are Not Able to Mate with the Sea, a Pity’\nMarah Hardt\n\nA lecture by Dr Marah Hardt capturing the intimate connections found in and around the ocean. This talk explores some of the ocean's most intimate acts and the impact on these strategies for sex and survival. It highlights the profound ways in which human behaviour disrupts the most vital and ancient acts of sea life, and pauses to consider the consequences as a reminder that hope is not lost.	\N	1	1	1	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of the participant(s) and TBA21–Academy	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	The Waves of the Oh!s and the Ah!s	\N	\N	\N	Ocean Space, Church of San Lorenzo, Venice, Italy	{"Markus Reymann","Francesca Thyssen-Bornemisza","Chus Martínez","Marah Hardt"}	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/2	\N	\N	t	\N

The film reveals various processes in the water that are hidden to the naked human eye. By investigating the brackish water, its inhabitants, its properties, and the traces left by human activities, the film is a reflection upon the relationship we humans have with our surroundings, especially through what we cannot see.	\N	1	0	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Marjolijn Dijkman and Toril Johannessen	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	{3000,1688}	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/10	\N	\N	t	\N

A study of the vegetal and animal life growing on discarded plastic was conducted on pieces collected from the Icelandic coast. Through the realisation of this intricate relationship of nature and human waste, an opportunity arises to consider marine litter’s presence as an animate material after human use, interacting with the landscape, and still very much a part of our world.

One of the tasks was the extraction of otoliths pairs from farmed salmons; unique crystals or bio-minerals that serve as a chemical diary of a fish. This seeded a reflection on how the microscopic crystals of the film material arrange themselves under a photochemical process.\n\nThis outline aims to translate the techno-antiseptic Cartesian environment constructed for a captive salmon through a grainy, imperfect 16mm film aesthetic. It is accompanied by an extract from a conversation with Sámi artist Ánde Somby in Tromsø, 2019.\n\n'The Bonding' will be produced thanks to the support from KORO and first premiered at Kunsthall 3,14, Bergen, Norway.\n\nConcept: Michelle-Marie Letelier\nDirector of Photography: Carlos Vasquez\nProduction and Editing: Carlos Vasquez & Michelle-Marie Letelier\nPost-production: Muscle Temple Lab	\N	1	0	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	16mm film transferred to HD	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Michelle-Marie Letelier	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	{1035,690}	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/36	\N	\N	t	\N

On the one hand, life, like the whale in the film, is dying because of pollution. On the other, people of the ocean – like the Maori community featured in this film – have agency in turning these tragedies into cultural life, finding a way of moving forward by honouring the dead and campaigning for a better political future.\n\nThe death of the whale leads people in the small village of Muriwai that it beached in to relearn the customary ways of removing her bones and curing them to make Taonga – cultural treasures – that in turn tell the history of their relationships. While her flesh is too toxic to be consumed as it was when the Pacific Ocean was cleaner, her soft bones can be used to fertilize Kauri trees that are dying. The whale thereby lives on in the healthy trees and carvings on the tribal meeting house, which keeps oral histories alive in contemporary art.\n\nThe video was made with the Rangiwaho community in Aotearoa/New Zealand during a time when their material culture was returned to them for the first time after being looted in the scientific raid of Captain Cook in 1769. It is in the context of this political agency that the whale is a sign, that from the tragic legacy of colonialism, new Taonga can be made. This is part of healing the colonial wound, and it is the wounds deep on Te Haa Kui o Tangaroa’s body that the viewer witnesses as Jody Toroa tells her story.	\N	1	1	0	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Ocean Space, Church of San Lorenzo, Venice, Italy	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Khadija von Zinnenburg Carroll and TBA21–Academy	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	{1280,720}	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/14	\N	\N	t	\N

The film uses a conceptual framework to provide an overview of the daily activities carried out by the expedition participants with an insight into their thoughts and feelings while embarking on the journey.\n\nThe expedition took place in March 2018 on board the M/Y Dardanella as part of TBA21–Academy’s ‘The Current II’ fellowship programme. The journey set the space to feel and think differently about the oceans, springing from the urge to reunite thinkers and artists to start a new school of sensing intelligence while exploring the questions: Is the Ocean an art space? Or a future space within the arts? How many waves are in the Ocean?

Laitinen’s artistic practice has touched upon the research into cognition and consciousness in other-than-human minds, focussing on octopuses in particular. This endeavour is emerging through different material agencies: glass objects made for octopuses, multiple video and audio works, and a series of glyphs—made both as a graphic font and as glass objects—derived from research on octopus arm movements. 'Haemocyanin' is a video installation documenting an octopus interacting with the glass objects. \n\nIn this series—intended to suggest ways of discovering alternative forms of communication—Laitinen is also exploring the power structures attendant to the formation of knowledge when researching lifeforms. The works are approaching the question of knowing as a porous and layered entanglement: a place where matter and language can coexist without divisions to binaries.	\N	1	0	1	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of ­­­­­­­the artist and Helsinki Contemporary	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/16	\N	\N	t	\N

The Technical Summary follows the structure of the Report.\n\nThe IPCC 'Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate' (SROCC), approved on 24 September 2019 by the 195 IPCC member governments, provides evidence for the benefits of limiting global warming to the lowest possible level – in line with the goal that governments set themselves in the 2015 Paris Agreement. The report finds that strongly reducing greenhouse gas emissions, protecting and restoring ecosystems, and carefully managing the use of natural resources would make it possible to preserve the ocean and cryosphere as a source of opportunities that support adaptation to future changes, limit risks to livelihoods and offer multiple additional societal benefits.\n\nThe 'SROCC' provides the best available scientific knowledge to empower governments and communities to take action, embedding that scientific knowledge on unavoidable change and plausible futures into their own context, to limit the scale of risks and climate impacts.\n\nThe report gives evidence of the benefits of combining scientific with local and indigenous knowledge to develop suitable options to manage climate change risks and enhance resilience. This is the first IPCC report that highlights the importance of education to enhance climate change, ocean and cryosphere literacy.	\N	0	0	1	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	{"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)"}	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/35	\N	\N	t	\N

Chapter 1 provides context on the importance of the ocean and cryosphere, and the framework for the assessments in subsequent chapters of the report.\n\nThe IPCC 'Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate' (SROCC), approved on 24 September 2019 by the 195 IPCC member governments, provides evidence for the benefits of limiting global warming to the lowest possible level – in line with the goal that governments set themselves in the 2015 Paris Agreement. The report finds that strongly reducing greenhouse gas emissions, protecting and restoring ecosystems, and carefully managing the use of natural resources would make it possible to preserve the ocean and cryosphere as a source of opportunities that support adaptation to future changes, limit risks to livelihoods and offer multiple additional societal benefits.\n\nThe 'SROCC' provides the best available scientific knowledge to empower governments and communities to take action, embedding that scientific knowledge on unavoidable change and plausible futures into their own context, to limit the scale of risks and climate impacts.\n\nThe report gives evidence of the benefits of combining scientific with local and indigenous knowledge to develop suitable options to manage climate change risks and enhance resilience. This is the first IPCC report that highlights the importance of education to enhance climate change, ocean and cryosphere literacy.	\N	0	0	1	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	{"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)"}	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/35	\N	\N	t	\N

This figure is a detailed illustration of petrifications mentioned in the article.\n\nIn this speculative project, artist Anne-Sophie Milon and geologist-paleontologist Jan Zalasiewicz asked, ‘What would a palaeontologist of the far future do if he, she (or indeed, it) came upon technofossils, the petrified artefacts of a long-extinct civilization?’ Through their research, they conceived the fossil 'Brunaspis enigmatica.' The project included various sketches, specimens and an imagined research paper in the form of an installation as part of the 2016 exhibition ‘Reset Modernity!’ at the ZKM Center for Art and Media in Karlsruhe, Germany.	\N	1	0	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	mixed media	147 x 88 cm	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Anne-Sophie Milon and Jan Zalasiewicz	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	{2359,3231}	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/7	\N	\N	t	\N

On the one hand, life, like the whale in the film, is dying because of pollution. On the other, people of the ocean – like the Maori community featured in this film – have agency in turning these tragedies into cultural life, finding a way of moving forward by honouring the dead and campaigning for a better political future.\n\nThe death of the whale leads people in the small village of Muriwai that it beached in to relearn the customary ways of removing her bones and curing them to make Taonga – cultural treasures – that in turn tell the history of their relationships. While her flesh is too toxic to be consumed as it was when the Pacific Ocean was cleaner, her soft bones can be used to fertilize Kauri trees that are dying. The whale thereby lives on in the healthy trees and carvings on the tribal meeting house, which keeps oral histories alive in contemporary art.\n\nThe video was made with the Rangiwaho community in Aotearoa/New Zealand during a time when their material culture was returned to them for the first time after being looted in the scientific raid of Captain Cook in 1769. It is in the context of this political agency that the whale is a sign, that from the tragic legacy of colonialism, new Taonga can be made. This is part of healing the colonial wound, and it is the wounds deep on Te Haa Kui o Tangaroa’s body that the viewer witnesses as Jody Toroa tells her story.	\N	1	1	0	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Ocean Space, Church of San Lorenzo, Venice, Italy	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Khadija von Zinnenburg Carroll and TBA21–Academy	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	{1280,845}	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/14	\N	\N	t	\N

By wearing the mask, the participants create an ocean of identical beings where identity is lost, and a sense of self merges into a collective identity, to metaphorically mimic an ecosystem.	\N	1	0	0	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Performance	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Mathilde Rosier and TBA21–Academy	\N	\N	870	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/2	\N	\N	t	\N

The journey set the space to feel and think differently about the oceans, springing from the urge to reunite thinkers and artists to start a new school of sensing intelligence while exploring the questions: Is the Ocean an art space? Or a future space within the arts? How many waves are in the Ocean?

The sound was projected during the following excerpt from Francesca Thyssen-Bornemisza's lecture-performance 'Sounds Too Many':\n\n"Water is a super conductor of sound, which explains why all species that inhabit the oceans are particularly sensitive to it. Its density carries sound not only faster, but much further than air. Becoming aware of the physics of water, as well as coming to terms with the unimaginable sound pollution that we subject all maritime species to, has moved me to join forces with all those who before me have tirelessly campaigned for quieter oceans!" \n\n'Sounds Too Many' is an immersive lecture-performance that places the ocean at center stage at a time when sound pollution is exploding by using sophisticated audio engineering and visualizations to put things into perspective. Thyssen-Bornemisza's lecture brings into question the unlimited and unregulated sonic pollution that the Anthropocene era has imposed on the ocean and the disruption it causes natural phenomena. \n\nThe soundscapes were produced by Ears Up Sound Design and the lecture-performance was commissioned by TBA21–Academy.	\N	1	0	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	{"Francesca Thyssen-Bornemisza"}	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Francesca Thyssen-Bornemisza and TBA21–Academy	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/31	\N	\N	t	\N

The journey set the space to feel and think differently about the oceans, springing from the urge to reunite thinkers and artists to start a new school of sensing intelligence while exploring the questions: Is the Ocean an art space? Or a future space within the arts? How many waves are in the Ocean?

The sound was projected alongside the following excerpt from Francesca Thyssen-Bornemisza's lecture-performance 'Sounds Too Many':\n\n"Seventy years ago, these recordings of a blue whale were still a complete mystery to the US Navy when they were first recorded. Believe it or not, they were originally thought to be an advanced secret technology developed by the Soviets in order to be able to track Allied forces submarines! The irony was that the severe paranoia which developed during the Cold War, inadvertently triggered a whole new understanding of sounds in the ocean, including whale communication."\n\nThe low-frequency of a blue whale is not audible on most portable devices. It could be heard clearly during the live performances thanks to advanced audio equipment by Meyer Sound Laboratories.\n\n'Sounds Too Many' is an immersive lecture-performance that places the ocean at center stage at a time when sound pollution is exploding by using sophisticated audio engineering and visualizations to put things into perspective. Thyssen-Bornemisza's lecture brings into question the unlimited and unregulated sonic pollution that the Anthropocene era has imposed on the ocean and the disruption it causes natural phenomena. \n\nThe soundscapes were produced by Ears Up Sound Design and the lecture-performance was commissioned by TBA21–Academy.	\N	1	0	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	{"Francesca Thyssen-Bornemisza"}	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Francesca Thyssen-Bornemisza and TBA21–Academy	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/31	\N	\N	t	\N

The Ocean is spherical because it is not beside the earth nor below it, but all around it. Its form is not what our eyes see, or not only. Its reality cannot be separated nor told apart from anything else on the lived earth, and therefore it poses a demand on us: the need for a philosophy to help us exercise the Ocean. It is difficult to describe what we are aiming for. I would say we are aiming for a philosophy more than anything else. It would be wrong to think that when one says “Ocean,” one is naming a “subject”. One could be as radical as stating that to say “Ocean” is, today, to say “art”. Art without the burden of institutional life, without the ideological twists of cultural politics, art as a practice that belongs and should belong to the artists, art facing the urgency of socializing with all those that care about life. Or, in other words, to say “Ocean” is to replace the historical notion of the avant-garde with a code that is not determined by form and the invention of new gestures, but by an investigation of the substance of life, identifying this as the mission of art.</p><p>At first sight there are “things” that can only be described in positive terms, like the Ocean. It is beautiful how some experiences of nature—of the Ocean—remind us that to live means first and foremost to feel the world around us. But sensibility is not just a faculty, sensibility is much more than that: it is an organ that both senses ourselves and others, and our life is through and through a sensible life. So, being at sea, I cannot but think of the many ways we need to—we must—rehabilitate sensible existence from its marginalization at the hands of modern philosophy, art, and politics and that the only way to do so is to create the conditions for philosophy, art, and politics by defining the ontological status of experience, of organic and inorganic intelligence.</p><p>The Ocean is making me aware of its philosophical status. Being at sea is being in an atmosphere, and being in an atmosphere is a very powerful image of thought, one that immediately calls for a challenge of the distribution of disciplines in the human sciences and humanities. I imagine a philosophy of the Ocean, a philosophy of plants, a philosophy of animals, as part of a philosophy of life that will, then, be entangled with all the developments in the philosophy of consciousness. I know that many think action is first, but how can we act differently if we are unable to deeply think/sense differently? Logically speaking, no real difference can emerge from a doing that only perpetuates or corrects and reforms past doing. Also, how can doing be separated from Modernity’s stubborn pretension to see the human spirit as achieved only through the material production of objects and their exchange, that is, material culture? So, doing cannot survive without an Ocean of conditions for biological existence… I see all this water and feel a monstrous urge to reunite all thinkers and artists to meet here and start this new school of sensing intelligence.&rsquo;</p><p>– Chus Martínez</p>	\N	1	0	0	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Chus Martínez and TBA21–Academy	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	{2280,1282}	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/30	\N	\N	t	\N

This video imagines the sun responding to The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's 'Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate.' The anthropomorphic subject of Benedict's video presents a message for all humans: If we are unable to identify with the Ocean, then we are really only trying to save ourselves.\n\nWritten in collaboration with Chus Martínez and commissioned by TBA21–Academy, Benedict’s six-part video reflects how language presents us with separate worlds of interests and realms which create barriers to the fact that we are all living in the same defenceless planet.	\N	1	0	0	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	Ocean Space, Church of San Lorenzo, Venice, Italy	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Will Benedict, DIS.ART and TBA21-Academy	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/15	\N	\N	t	\N

They know that the storm churns up nutrients, which in turn feed the zooplankton, that is a major source of food for most whale species."\n\n'Sounds Too Many' is an immersive lecture-performance that places the ocean at center stage at a time when sound pollution is exploding by using sophisticated audio engineering and visualizations to put things into perspective. Thyssen-Bornemisza's lecture brings into question the unlimited and unregulated sonic pollution that the Anthropocene era has imposed on the ocean and the disruption it causes natural phenomena. \n\nThe soundscapes were produced by Ears Up Sound Design and the lecture-performance was commissioned by TBA21–Academy.	\N	1	0	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	{"Francesca Thyssen-Bornemisza"}	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Francesca Thyssen-Bornemisza and TBA21–Academy	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/31	\N	\N	t	\N

It is a reminder that we must bring light to the crisis impacting life of our Ocean and draw attention to the urgent need to elevate and change the values and practices of private industry, policy and our own personal choices to address responsibly sustainable development goals (SDG14) set by the United Nations. The performance unfolds in an urban environment highly dependent on the health of the oceans, even though it may not be overtly obvious to our urban communities. 'Intervention: Ocean Blues' invites audiences to acknowledge our intersecting identities and, to celebrate and honor them by changing behaviors to protect our oceans. The performance combines dance, procession, textile sculpture, ritual and improvisational interactions with the audience.\n\nThis iteration was performed in Brooklyn, New York on August 29th, 2018 after its premiere at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, Boston, Massachusetts on August 9th, 2018.	\N	1	1	0	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	performance	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Laura Anderson Barbata	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N

I imagine that lion in the jungle, at ease, thoughtful, leaving behind, without a nostalgic hint, his time as a ferocious predator. I fantasise about the conversations he has with the lionesses (who were really the true hunters) and lions about the struggles of the past, the life battles that an accurate bite stopped at once. Ah! Now the rejoicing is another, hours of conversation with the gazelles ... what a world of theirs ...</p><p>Let us now think of another concept, that of “climate change”.

The sound was projected alongside the following excerpt from Francesca Thyssen-Bornemisza's lecture-performance 'Sounds Too Many':\n \n"The sounds of a super-pod of 20,000 Spinner dolphins during an expedition to Cocos Island during a TBA21-Academy expedition. None of us had ever seen so many dolphins in our lives!

These massive fishing vessels even use helicopters to spot the dolphins on the surface, because they hunt together with the tuna below. We intercepted it about 100 miles off shore, just along the pacific ridge where the pelagic species like to hunt, and preferably migrate. After the trawler had passed, quickly pulling up its nets in order to not be observed fishing in illegal waters, we witnessed the carnage that its massive nets had left in its path: A mere scattering of dolphins here and there. The super pod of spinners, and presumably the tuna below, had been decimated."\n\n'Sounds Too Many' is an immersive lecture-performance that places the ocean at center stage at a time when sound pollution is exploding by using sophisticated audio engineering and visualizations to put things into perspective.

Ringwoodite, which holds water in the form of hydrogen and oxygen bound together, can only be found in the earth’s transition zone, between 410 and 660 kilometers below the earth’s surface. Until now, it had only been artificially created in laboratories or found in asteroid rocks. In the meantime, seismic wave analysis has suggested the presence of a vast repository of ringwoodite beneath the USA, and further studies are in process in other geographies.\n\nGiven that water scarcity will only worsen throughout the twenty-first century, this video speculates on a near future in which ringwoodite as well as rare minerals found in nearby asteroids will be the objects of a new mining economy. Perhaps in this future, both the earth’s interior and outer space will become new capitalist frontiers, similarly to the role played by gold and silver mining in the colonial past.\n\nThis video was produced with the support of Berardo Museum Collection, Lisbon, in the context of a commission for the exhibition 'Matter Fictions,' curated by Margarida Mendes, May 4 – August 30, 2016.	\N	1	0	1	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	Berardo Museum Collection, Lisbon	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Inhabitants	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://inhabitants-tv.org/may2016_miningforringwoodite.html	\N	\N	t	\N

As a consequence, the average pH of ocean surface water has dropped from 8.2 to 8.1 since the beginning of the industrial era—a 25 percent increase in acidity over the past two centuries, which is a rate not experienced in the last 55 million years. The form in which this chemical transition of ocean acidification unfolds can be thought in the terms of what Elizabeth Povinelli names the “quasi-event;” a slow, seeping state change occurring below technologically unmediated human modes of perception. Never directly rupturing the present, ocean acidification manifests instead as a low, corrosive hum of strain on the lives lived in these zones. Expressed across bodies, the corrosivity of this acid has appeared as many undoings, from the dissolve of shells to the biosemiotic scrambling of fish, but the expression of acidification is refracted by the terms of the arts and sciences. Building on field work undertaken with marine biologists at the Great Barrier Reef this essay will track the shifting chemistry of the hydrosphere as mediated by science, ecological theory, aesthetic form, and the marine bodies increasingly steeped in carbonic acid, and suggests an immersive analytic of acid to consider a planetary condition of dissolve.	\N	0	0	1	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Megan Hayes	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N

Our obsession with online shopping and cheap goods has led to the shipping industry boom, doubling in size and transport capacity from 450 million to 975 millions tons in the past 10 years.

We analyzed 748 samples for size, mass, and material composition collected from surface net tows on 11 expeditions from Cape Cod, Massachusetts to the Caribbean Sea between 1991 and 2007. Particles were mostly fragments less than 10 mm in size with nearly all lighter than 0.05 g. Material densities ranged from 0.808 to 1.24 g ml-1, with about half between 0.97 and 1.04 g ml-1, a range not typically found in virgin plastics. Elemental analysis suggests that samples in this density range are consistent with polypropylene and polyethylene whose densities have increased, likely due to biofouling. Pelagic densities varied considerably from that of beach plastic debris, suggesting that plastic particles are modified during their residence at sea. These analyses provide clues in understanding particle fate and potential debris sources, and address ecological implications of pelagic plastic debris.	\N	0	0	1	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	{"Skye Morét","Kara Lavender Law","Giora Proskurowski","Ellen K.

We are allowed two today – Art and Love. The third is forever foreclosed.\n\n'Fragments from Khi + Ordo' draws upon an unfinished cycle of transmedia works produced by the Out of India Collective, from 2017 to 2019, and here re-formatted and presented by the Metropolitan Transmedia Authority. Khi, having escaped totalitarian Ordo, travels by groundwater, from lake to ocean, in pursuit of memories, banished by Ordo. The journey depicted here begins at The Conflictorium, in Ahmedabad, India, with 'The Dying Mermaid.' The mermaid chases Khi’s boat across the Arabian Sea. She drowns in a storm. Khi is then inexplicably shipwrecked in Venice, where he first discovers books. He sends them back to Ahmedabad encased in lead, disguised as artworks. He then vanishes. He is pursued by the Venusians, two storytellers from the future. They lose track of him in Venice and then London. They return to Ahmedabad in 2019 to re-create and tell his story under the auspices of the Abhivyakti City Arts Project. Amidst that 15-day presentation, Khi re-appears briefly and then vanishes again.\n\n'Fragments from Khi + Ordo' invoke the “oceanic” epic, the High Romantic prospects of the sea, storms, shipwrecks, endings and new beginnings. It is said that civilization began with a shipwreck. The performative tale of Khi + Ordo is also a tale of beginnings and endings – of a story as shipwreck. The story is told in low-resolution, transmedia fashion, invoking silent-film era values and the anti-spectacular premises of the intermedial arts. The project invokes a form of preposterous or speculative presentism (“suspended time”) within the internal metric of time-based media.	\N	1	0	0	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	video	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of OOI Collective and Metropolitan Transmedia Authority	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	01070000A0E6100000010000000101000080315C1D0071255240618BDD3EAB0837400000000000000000	t	\N

Despite increasing oil and natural gas exploration and exploitation, the deep ocean of Trinidad and Tobago is almost entirely unknown. The only scientific team to image the deep seafloor within the Trinidad and Tobago Exclusive Economic Zone was from IFREMER in the 1980s. That exploration led to the discovery of the El Pilar methane seeps and associated chemosynthetic communities on the accretionary prism to the east of Trinidad and Tobago. In 2014, the E/V Nautilus, in collaboration with local scientists, visited two previously sampled as well as two unexplored areas of the El Pilar site between 998 and 1,629 m depth using remotely operated vehicles. Eighty-three megafaunal morphospecies from extensive chemosynthetic communities surrounding active methane seepage were observed at four sites. These communities were dominated by megafaunal invertebrates including mussels (Bathymodiolus childressi), shrimp (Alvinocaris cf. muricola), Lamellibrachia sp. 2 tubeworms, and Pachycara caribbaeum. Adjacent to areas of active seepage was an ecotone of suspension feeders including Haplosclerida sponges, stylasterids and Neovermilia serpulids on authigenic carbonates. Beyond this were large Bathymodiolus shell middens. Finally there was either a zone of sparse octocorals and other non-chemosynthetic species likely benefiting from the carbonate substratum and enriched production within the seep habitat, or sedimented inactive areas. This paper highlights these ecologically significant areas and increases the knowledge of the biodiversity of the Trinidad and Tobago deep ocean. Because methane seepage and chemosynthetic communities are related to the presence of extractable oil and gas resources, development of best practices for the conservation of biodiversity in Trinidad and Tobago waters within the context of energy extraction is critical. Potential impacts on benthic communities during oil and gas activities will likely be long lasting and include physical disturbance during drilling among others. Recommendations for the stewardship of these widespread habitats include: (1) seeking international cooperation; (2) holding wider stakeholder discussions; (3) adopting stringent environmental regulations; and (4) increasing deep-sea research to gather crucial baseline data in order to conduct appropriate marine spatial planning with the creation of marine protected areas.	\N	0	1	1	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Diva J.

Can we expand the environmental agenda through science and art? Can contemporary art and moving image sensitize their audience over issues of environmental protection?\n\nPolyeco Contemporary Art Initiative (PCAI) launches its first Artist-in-Residence program focusing on the interaction between contemporary art and environmental consciousness. The PCAI selection committee, consisting of Hans Ulrich Obrist, Serpentine Galleries Artistic Director, Krist Gruijthuijsen, KW Institute for Contemporary Art Director, Athanasios Polychronopoulos, PCAI Director and Founder and Kika Kyriakakou, PCAI Residency Artistic Director, has selected artists Rindon Johnson and Lito Kattou to participate in the programme in 2020.\n\nThe campaign video includes imagery from Saskia Olde Wolbers work 'Pfui — Pish, Pshaw / Prr' (2017) commissioned by PCAI. The particular imagery from the Saskia Olde Wolbers' PCAI Collection video features sonar imaging attempts around an unsalvageable cruise ship in Santorini. Sonar is a technology used in medicine and marine archaeology and the artist uses it here in an art context to visualise sea pollution in the area.	\N	1	0	0	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Polyeco Contemporary Art Initiative (PCAI)	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://www.pcai.gr/projects/pcai-residency-2019-open-call-2/	\N	\N	t	\N

During a three-day workshop on the interdependency with the ocean, the students asked questions expressing their doubts, fears, impressions and knowledge. The workshops led to on-camera discussions taking place over two morning sessions between August and September 2019.\n\nARTPORT_making waves commissioned the film as part of the interdisciplinary art project 'WE ARE OCEAN' as a contribution to the 'UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development' (2021-2030) and the 'Ocean Literacy Program of IOC-UNESCO' (www.oceandecade.org). These voices are carried around the world with interdisciplinary art components including science and education in Berlin, Brandenburg, Venice, Lisbon, Marseille, Vancouver, Mumbai and Glasgow from 2019-2021. In Berlin and Brandenburg, ARTPORT_making waves commissioned artist Lisa Rave to organize targeted workshops at selected schools for students aged 13 to 17. The results of the workshops and dialogical exchange were discussed with prominent thinkers such as Prof. Dr. Antje Boetius (Alfred-Wegener-Institute), Dr. Thierry Pérez (Institut Pythéas Marseille), Markus Reymann (TBA21–Academy) and artists Michelle-Marie Letelier and Lisa Rave at the 'Marine Regions Forum 2019.' The project was later presented to a broader audience at the 'FUTURIUM Berlin' with interactive interventions of the students, film screenings and a fishbowl panel discussion with Markus Reymann, Prof. Dr. Antje Boetius, Sebastian Unger (Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies Potsdam) and Dr. Lukas Köhler (Member of the German Parliament). Furthermore, there were similar events organized at CLB Berlin and STATE Studio Berlin with interactive and participatory elements involving young people and the audience.\n\n'WE ARE OCEAN' brings together younger generations with politicians, academics and other decision-makers to think about feasible solutions. The project continues to promote the regular implementation of external scholarly-artistic workshops into the curriculum of schools to provide first-hand knowledge in creative ways and involve the youth in international processes, giving them an active voice.	\N	1	1	0	\N	\N	DE	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Lisa Rave	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N

Nguyen and Patrick Heimbach produced a video animation in collaboration with visualization specialist Greg Foss from the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC). The animation is a sequence of graphic renderings of a computer simulation, which shows the water temperatures of the Arctic Ocean at a given time. The color of each pixel reﬂects a temperature value deﬁned in a legend. By putting the images into a time sequence, the evolution of temperatures over time becomes visible.\n \nThe animation shows the circulation in the Arctic Ocean and its surrounding seas. The warm water of subtropical North Atlantic origin ﬂows through the Nordic and Barents Seas into the Arctic. Salty, and thus heavy, this water subducts beneath the fresh surface. Earth’s rotation, wind, and the steep slopes of the ocean bottom steer the ﬂow of the warm water toward the Western Arctic, where some of it exits through the Fram Strait, a passage between Greenland and Svalbard. On the western side of the basin, warm and fresh water from the Paciﬁc Ocean enters through the Bering Strait in the summer. This water, lighter than water of Atlantic origin, remains near the surface and eventually exits the Arctic through the Canadian Archipelago or the Fram Strait. In the animation, this inﬂux of warm water from the Atlantic into the Arctic is highlighted by color-coding. Its observed recent increase and spread to near the surface of the Arctic Ocean is a phenomenon scientists call “Arctic Atlantiﬁcation.” In their research, Nguyen and Heimbach seek relationships between this phenomenon, the mass loss of the Greenland ice sheet, and the decline in the summer Arctic sea ice cover.	\N	1	0	1	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	MP4 Video	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of An T.

From this data we defined an accumulation zone (25 to 41°N, 130 to 180°W) in the North Pacific subtropical gyre that closely corresponds to centers of accumulation, resulting from the convergence of ocean surface currents predicted by several oceanographic numerical models. Maximum plastic concentrations from individual surface net tows exceeded 106 pieces km−2, with concentrations decreasing with increasing distance from the predicted center of accumulation. Outside the North Pacific subtropical gyre, the median plastic concentration was 0 pieces km−2. We were unable to detect a robust temporal trend in the data set, perhaps because of confounded spatial and temporal variability. Large spatiotemporal variability in plastic concentration causes order of magnitude differences in summary statistics calculated over short time periods or in limited geographic areas. Utilizing all available plankton net data collected in the eastern Pacific Ocean (17.4°S to 61.0°N; 85.0 to 180.0°W) since 1999, we estimated a minimum of 21 290 t of floating microplastic.	\N	0	0	1	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	{"Kara Lavender Law","Skye Morét","Deborah S.

Episode 4: A Deep Sea Mining Glossary	\N	\N	For the last two years, the series ‘What is Deep Sea Mining?’ has been investigating deep sea mining, in an effort to both inform about and help to pre-empt this, for now hypothetical, industry. The jump from speculation to reality is, however, short. One could say that there is no deep sea mining industry. Rather, what is being pushed is a discourse, a language, and an imaginary (a speculation), creating the conditions for financial interests to establish this new economic frontier as unavoidable.\n\nThroughout this period of investigation, talking to different sources and reading from articles and documents ranging from economics and mining to biology and geology, Inhabitants stumbled upon certain, key words, terms, and concepts. Depending on who spoke them, however, their meaning shifted. They were polymorphic terms, open to the interpretation of different stakeholders of deep sea mining or its opponents.\n\nThis episode is a tentative and brief glossary of terms invoked in debates around deep sea mining. Inhabitants wrote them based on interviews with various sources, as well as official industry media, legal definitions and dictionary entries. The episode hopes to reveal something about how deep sea mining is a contested, polyphonic site, with the future of the seabed and its ecologies up for grabs.\n\n'What is Deep Sea Mining?' is a TBA21–Academy commission developed by Inhabitants (Mariana Silva and Pedro Neves Marques), an online channel for exploratory video and documentary reporting, in collaboration with Margarida Mendes, curator and activist from Lisbon, Portugal, and founding member of Oceano Livre environmental movement against deep sea mining.	\N	1	0	1	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Inhabitants and TBA21–Academy	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/19	\N	\N	t	\N

This implies an urgent transition to renewable energy sources as well as radical adaptive measures, which collide against established industrial monopolies. This video gathers several geoengineering patent applications, and through these documents presents the history of these emerging technologies and the private interests, actors, think tanks, and corporations behind them.\n\nWithin the debate of climate change mitigation, geoengineering—the technological management of weather patterns and carbon capture processes—occupies an especially politicized place. It has slowly entered climate change discussions, including those held by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. While the legitimate use of such technologies and their regulation remains unaddressed by the UN, a rush to patent these technologies is underway.	\N	1	1	0	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Inhabitants	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://inhabitants-tv.org/sept2015_geoengineering.html	\N	\N	t	\N

The inherent iterative and generative nature of ‘The Dying Mermaid’ session from 2017 is re-projected in 2019 in test sessions in a small apartment on the outskirts of Ahmedabad – here denoted “Room A-702.” The images both inhabit and overspill the model. The memories associated with the originary session elide sea and memory. Resonances with the mesmeric sea of Andrei Tarkovsky’s 1972 film ‘Solaris’ are made self-evident, notwithstanding Slavoj Žižek’s Lacanian reading of ‘Solaris’ in ‘The Thing from Inner Space’ (2000). These apartment sessions then inform the 15-day performance at Abhivyakti in Dinesh Hall. The mythic dimensions of sea and memory collide when the performances at Abhivyakti begin to invoke the presence of what the Venusian storytellers have come to call “It.” ‘It’ is the haunted tableau of the ongoing project, from inception to re-play and re-mix – over the course of two years. 	\N	1	0	0	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	video	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of OOI Collective and Metropolitan Transmedia Authority	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	01070000A0E6100000010000000101000080315C1D0071255240618BDD3EAB0837400000000000000000	t	\N

To capture the diversity of vibrant life that she saw during her seasonal work with the US Antarctic Program, artist Skye Morét compared colour pixels from 100 photographs taken above and below the waves of the Antarctic Peninsula. Fifty upper bars represent images captured of the land and seascape above the sea surface, while fifty lower bars exemplify the vibrant and varied world beneath the waves. The juxtaposition of colour and intensity exposes our assumptions of a ‘colourless’ Antarctica and reveals a surprising realm below — one that tends to be neglected in popular dialogue about a quickly warming Antarctic Peninsula. In that light, it is the artist’s hope that experiential media can engender a rich cultural consciousness and connection to Antarctica, a continent most people will never experience and can barely conceive.

Due to our emissions of greenhouse gases, the sea becomes more and more acidic. Off the coast of southern Italy, the continental plates of Europe and Africa meet and large amounts of carbon dioxide leak out from volcanic cracks in the seabed. This creates acidic environments in the sea. In this environment researchers can predict how life on the seabed will be in the future if our greenhouse gas emissions continue at current levels. The more carbon the ocean absorbs, the more acidic it will become, and mussels and corals are in danger of dissolving entirely. \n\t \t \t\nMunan Øvrelid has been in southern Italy and collected acid damaged shells, coral and plants near the cracks in the sea. Where still life painting traditionally is seen to have a memento mori, a reminder about that we are human and are all going to die, Munan Øvrelid's painting points to that we are now causing death and extinction in nature. In a contemporary painting process, the uniqueness of the rendered objects appears clearly and nuanced, in contrast to how things in our language are often categorized by type and number.\n\nThis painting is included in ‘The Wild Living Marine Resources Belong to Society as a Whole’ (2017), an anthology of works helping us to understand, express and manage environmental issues in new and better ways.	\N	1	0	0	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of ­­­­­­­Munan Øvrelid / The Wild Living Marine Resources Belong to Society as a Whole	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/18	\N	\N	t	\N

Though beluga whales travel in pods, this young whale separated from others, got nicknamed as Benny by us. I developed this work from a workshop I led at the Thames River during the time Benny was around. This was a deep listening workshop, where 'deep' was taken quite literally as in the depths of the river. With the aid of hydrophones, we listened to the water. With the lost beluga wandering the Thames, I was wondering whether it was what Benny heard of us that brought him so close? The video captures the lost beluga swirling around on the transparent grid superimposed with the recorded sound from below the city.	\N	1	0	0	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	field recording and digital animation	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Eda Şarman	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	01070000A0E6100000020000000101000080CBDAA6785C54C5BF9012BBB6B7BD4940000000000000000001010000809012BBB6B7BD4940CBDAA6785C54C5BFAED85F764F1E66BF	t	\N

Their distribution in both the terrestrial and marine realms suggests that they are a key geological indicator of the Anthropocene, as a distinctive stratal component. Most immediately evident in terrestrial deposits, they are clearly becoming widespread in marine sedimentary deposits in both shallow- and deep-water settings. They are abundant and widespread as macroscopic fragments and virtually ubiquitous as microplastic particles; these are dispersed by both physical and biological processes, not least via the food chain and the ‘faecal express’ route from surface to sea floor. Plastics are already widely dispersed in sedimentary deposits, and their amount seems likely to grow several-fold over the next few decades. They will continue to be input into the sedimentary cycle over coming millennia as temporary stores – landfill sites – are eroded. Plastics already enable fine time resolution within Anthropocene deposits via the development of their different types and via the artefacts (‘technofossils’) they are moulded into, and many of these may have long-term preservation potential when buried in strata.	\N	0	0	1	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Jan Zalasiewicz	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2213305416300029?via%3Dihub	\N	\N	t	\N

To capture the diversity of vibrant life that she saw during her seasonal work with the US Antarctic Program, artist Skye Morét compared colour pixels from 100 photographs taken above and below the waves of the Antarctic Peninsula. Fifty upper bars represent images captured of the land and seascape above the sea surface, while fifty lower bars exemplify the vibrant and varied world beneath the waves. The juxtaposition of colour and intensity exposes our assumptions of a ‘colourless’ Antarctica and reveals a surprising realm below — one that tends to be neglected in popular dialogue about a quickly warming Antarctic Peninsula. In that light, it is the artist’s hope that experiential media can engender a rich cultural consciousness and connection to Antarctica, a continent most people will never experience and can barely conceive.	\N	1	1	1	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Digital gestural interface	2m x 2m x 2m	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Skye Morét	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	{1500,1020}	https://dublin.sciencegallery.com/ledges/exhibits/antarctica-a-chromatic-paradox/	\N	\N	t	\N

Together with Bengolea, the video features Craig Black Eagle, Oshane Overload, Nick Overload, and Teroy Overload performing dance routines under heavy rainfall and a turbulent thunderstorm. Their movements refer to popular Jamaican Dancehall, a highly sexualized dance style, which Bengolea sees as infused with magical healing powers. The screening is followed by a participatory public dance inside the Church of San Lorenzo led by Bengolea in the spirit of sharing movement.	\N	1	0	0	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	video and performance 	00:11:29	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Cecilia Bengolea and TBA21–Academy	\N	\N	688	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/2	\N	\N	t	\N

To capture the diversity of vibrant life that she saw during her seasonal work with the US Antarctic Program, artist Skye Morét compared colour pixels from 100 photographs taken above and below the waves of the Antarctic Peninsula. Fifty upper bars represent images captured of the land and seascape above the sea surface, while fifty lower bars exemplify the vibrant and varied world beneath the waves. The juxtaposition of colour and intensity exposes our assumptions of a ‘colourless’ Antarctica and reveals a surprising realm below — one that tends to be neglected in popular dialogue about a quickly warming Antarctic Peninsula. In that light, it is the artist’s hope that experiential media can engender a rich cultural consciousness and connection to Antarctica, a continent most people will never experience and can barely conceive.

It is a reminder that we must bring light to the crisis impacting life of our Ocean and draw attention to the urgent need to elevate and change the values and practices of private industry, policy and our own personal choices to address responsibly sustainable development goals (SDG14) set by the United Nations. The performance unfolded in an urban environment highly dependent on the health of the oceans, even though it may not be overtly obvious to our urban communities. 'Intervention: Ocean Blues' invites audiences to acknowledge our intersecting identities and, to celebrate and honor them by changing behaviors to protect our oceans. The performance combines dance, procession, textile sculpture, ritual and improvisational interactions with the audience.	\N	1	1	0	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	performance	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Laura Anderson Barbata	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N

Three main screens reveal parts of the process; a fourth and smaller screen shows thriving coral outplanted to the reef with the fish that have returned to live in its habitat. This fourth channel is only one possible end to a story that is otherwise full of questions. Swirling’s processes are alternately pragmatic and surreal and point to human ingenuity and folly in the face of catastrophic climate change. The work is named for one of the shooting locations, the “Swirling Reef of Death”, and the “swirling” of factors that will determine the unknown outcome of the coral restoration narrative.	\N	1	1	0	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of the artist(s)	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	01070000A0E61000000100000001010000804AC5D987CF3850C086371C347FB531401D2BFFD3333974BF	t	\N

Fossil coral skeletons also present a rich record that enables paleontological analysis of coral origins, tracing them back to the Triassic (~241 Myr). While numerous invertebrate lineages were eradicated at the last major mass extinction boundary, the Cretaceous-Tertiary/K-T (66 Myr), a number of Scleractinian corals survived. We review this history and assess traits correlated with K-T mass extinction survival. Disaster-related "survival" traits that emerged from our analysis are: (1) deep water residing (>100 m); (2) cosmopolitan distributions, (3) non-symbiotic, (4) solitary or small colonies and (5) bleaching-resistant. We then compared these traits to the traits of modern Scleractinian corals, using to IUCN Red List data, and report that corals with these same survival traits have relatively stable populations, while those lacking them are presently decreasing in abundance and diversity. This shows corals exhibiting a similar dynamic survival response as seen at the last major extinction, the K-T. While these results could be seen as promising, that some corals may survive the Anthropocene extinction, they also highlight how our relatively-fragile Primate order does not possess analogous "survival" characteristics, nor have a record of mass extinction survival as some corals are capable.	\N	0	0	1	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of the authors	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Scientific Reports	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60605-2#citeas	\N	\N	t	\N

The journey set the space to feel and think differently about the oceans, springing from the urge to reunite thinkers and artists to start a new school of sensing intelligence while exploring the questions: Is the Ocean an art space? Or a future space within the arts? How many waves are in the Ocean?

Episode 3: The Azores Case	\N	\N	The third episode of the web series 'What is Deep Sea Mining?' is set on the Azores archipelago, an autonomous region of Portugal located in the North Atlantic Ocean. Composed of nine volcanic islands that once thrived on the whaling industry, the Azores have since become a hot spot for research in marine biology due to its diverse ecosystems, as it is located above an active triple junction between the Eurasian, African, and North-American tectonic plates.\n\nIn 2008, one year before Portugal submitted its proposal to extend its continental shelf to the United Nations, the Canadian mining company Nautilus Minerals Inc. presented a proposal for mineral prospection and exploration in six areas off the coast of the Azores. Despite the fact that deep sea mining continues to be under debate between different governmental bodies, no effort was done to inform the wider public or local citizens about such plans.\n\nThis episode is based on interviews with different specialists in marine biology based in the islands, among them José Nuno Gomes-Pereira, Teresa Cerqueira, Telmo Morato, and Gisela Dionísio, as well as member of the European Parliament Ricardo Serrão Santos, on the potential impacts of deep sea mining on local ecosystems and on the archipelago’s economical reality.\n\n'What is Deep Sea Mining?' is a TBA21–Academy commission developed by Inhabitants (Mariana Silva and Pedro Neves Marques), an online channel for exploratory video and documentary reporting, in collaboration with Margarida Mendes, curator and activist from Lisbon, Portugal, and founding member of Oceano Livre environmental movement against deep sea mining.	\N	1	0	1	\N	\N	PT	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Inhabitants and TBA21–Academy	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/19	\N	\N	t	\N

Whilst keeping the coral in captivity is, dishearteningly, the fundamental condition of Jamie Craggs’ research, the scientists and the coral also become entangled in sharing a space for living, working and world-making, expanding the range of possible worlds in common.	\N	1	0	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Sonia Levy	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	{1920,1080}	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/8	\N	\N	t	\N

The film is a comment on the pervasive environmental issues and extinction caused by plastic pollution and single-use waste. The film is a collage-like accumulation of video material filmed between 2016-2019 in Australia, Ecuador, New Zealand, Spain and the United Kingdom, accompanied by an original sound piece. The imagined journey of a plastic bottle through the land, across water arteries and into the depths of the sea tells a present-day story of the humankind dependency on synthesised materials. It attempts to show how our behavioural patterns result in the immeasurable harm to all the living organisms and ecosystems. The film contrasts the disposable to the pristine, clashing snippets of human-made environments and marine debris with glimpses of wildlife, remote islands and subsea activities. ‘Fathomless, Part I’ is equally a portrayal of the ocean as something unfathomable, dynamic, hybrid and changeable; the largest habitat to the multiplicity of life forms that is extremely sensitive and must be protected from the violence of the Anthropocene era.	\N	1	1	0	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Digital Video	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Aennor	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N

Palm trees rising, on previously barren islands, are often the result of such voyage. Which form could this resilient plant take, confronted to a world with higher sea levels and disappearing atolls? Unable to reach any dry sand, could the leaves take a downward direction and mimic the behaviour of the feather starfish? The work dreams an encounter between the two species caught in an aimless storm and moody currents. The arrows refer to the wind and current patterns found on weather charts with no clear trajectory.\n\nIt is beyond reason to anticipate how creatures might evolve while facing environmental changes. The installation addresses the issues of climate change from an emotional perspective acknowledging the difficulty to face the paradoxical movements of our times heading into countless directions.	\N	1	0	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	installation, painted wood, concrete, nylon	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Forlane 6 Studio: Hortense Le Calvez & Mathieu Goussin	\N	\N	3663	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://forlane6studio.com/portfolio/disoriented-2017/	\N	01070000A0E6100000010000000101000080973B33C1707237405E0EBBEF18AC42400000000000000000	t	\N

The plastic particles are collected in the North and South Atlantic, the North and South Pacific and the Indian Ocean. These micro-plastics, particles smaller than 5mm, are one of the most underestimated global threats for the environment and our own health. In the open sea they attract oil-based pollutants like PCB’s, CFK’s and DDT’s, poisoning all marine life. Through bioaccumulation, the passing on and multiplying of toxins through the food chain, the largest and most toxic amount is reserved for the top predator: humans.

The plastic particles are collected in the North and South Atlantic, the North and South Pacific and the Indian Ocean. These micro-plastics, particles smaller than 5mm, are one of the most underestimated global threats for the environment and our own health. In the open sea they attract oil-based pollutants like PCB’s, CFK’s and DDT’s, poisoning all marine life. Through bioaccumulation, the passing on and multiplying of toxins through the food chain, the largest and most toxic amount is reserved for the top predator: humans. The micro-plastics are preserved in a universally known tourist souvenir, like a time capsule for the future.

Fixing on waves as scientific things—amalgams of the formally described and materially instantiated, of the conceptual and empirical—the project examines how scientists apprehend and model waves as entities that cross the boundaries of the human and the ahuman, the agentive and the overdetermined, and the cultural and the natural. What waves are taken to be—their ontology—is in transformation as novel scientific modes of measurement, inscription, and description bring them into legibility. This Lecture centers on the story of ocean wave science, ethnographically reporting on how scientists think about whether seawater waves (canonically imagined as not evolving, not decaying, but simply repeating) may be transforming in synchrony with the geological, social, and economic epoch that some scholars in atmospheric chemistry, geology, history, philosophy, and anthropology are coming to call the Anthropocene. The Lecture puts the notion of the Anthropocene under analytic pressure, particularly by attending to the politics of how ocean waves are modeled and known in the northern and southern hemispheres. It concludes with a discussion of wave science as a kind of anthropology by other means.	\N	0	0	1	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Stefan Helmreich	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Lewis Henry Morgan Lectures	\N	\N	\N	University of Rochester, Department of Anthropology	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://vimeo.com/114869573	\N	\N	t	\N

Climate change has upset this observation and small Pacific island states and territories are trying to make their voices heard. Their survival depends on it. The Polynesian Leaders Group (PLG) attempts to improve the effectiveness of this trend through the adoption of declarations to protect the island territories and the ocean. Related to the Polynesian cultural background, creative ideas have been proposed by the PLG and had a certain impact on the latest international negotiations on climate change and the protection of the environment.	\N	0	1	1	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Raimana Hervé Lallemant-Moe	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	t	\N

These figures are illustrations of organisms reconstructed from petrifaction and the reconstruction of functional biology.\n\nIn this speculative project, artist Anne-Sophie Milon and geologist-paleontologist Jan Zalasiewicz asked, ‘What would a palaeontologist of the far future do if he, she (or indeed, it) came upon technofossils, the petrified artefacts of a long-extinct civilization?’ Through their research, they conceived the fossil 'Brunaspis enigmatica.' The project included various sketches, specimens and an imagined research paper in the form of an installation as part of the 2016 exhibition ‘Reset Modernity!’ at the ZKM Center for Art and Media in Karlsruhe, Germany.	\N	1	0	1	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	mixed media	147 x 88 cm	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Anne-Sophie Milon and Jan Zalasiewicz	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	{2958,2186}	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/7	\N	\N	t	\N

Here, we present a time series of plastic content at the surface of the western North Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea from 1986 to 2008. More than 60% of 6136 surface plankton net tows collected buoyant plastic pieces, typically millimeters in size. The highest concentration of plastic debris was observed in subtropical latitudes and associated with the observed large-scale convergence in surface currents predicted by Ekman dynamics. Despite a rapid increase in plastic production and disposal during this time period, no trend in plastic concentration was observed in the region of highest accumulation.	\N	0	0	1	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	{"Kara Lavender Law","Skye Morét","Nikolai A.

Define science-based safe and sustainable thresholds for economic operations in the Mediterranean Sea driving the sustainable exploitation of non-renewable resources and the resources based on the Mediterranean Sea natural and cultural heritage. Encompass sustainable food production and the links between tourism and the environment in the perspective of the circular and inclusive blue economy. During the Decade, we will promote the development of new innovative technological solutions for harvesting including blue biotechnology, the consolidation of our knowledge on existing living and non-renewable resources, the definition of science-based baselines and thresholds of sustainability, and the identification of the trade-offs between ecological dynamics and socio-economics needs. Local communities will be strongly involved into the decision process and synergies between tourisms and other productive, public and private, sectors will be promoted.

These giant circular ocean currents collect and contain plastic from around the world. Plastic Reef grew in size parallel to the increasing exposure and awareness that was slowly awakening. Every time the work was exhibited it became bigger as more and more plastic was added. In total more than 1000kg of plastic debris was fished out between 2008 and 2013. In 2015 scientists discovered that natural coral was ingesting micro-plastics, poisoning itself in the process. Next to acidification and water temperature rising, this is one of the main reasons for the disappearance of the Great Barrier Reef.	\N	1	1	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	melted plastic debris from the world's oceans	variable	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of the artist and Meessen De Clercq Gallery, Brussels	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	{3543,2363}	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/17	\N	\N	t	\N

The work could be experienced in Vlychos Beach on Hydra Island during the summer of 2016. Autotomy (from the Greek auto ”self” and tome “severing”) is defined as the reflex separation of a part from the body. This spontaneous division occurs with certain animals when facing an imminent threat. This automatic release, letting go of a part of oneself to the attacker in order to flee, allows the animal a greater chance of survival. Our disarticulated wood installation depicts a sunken village on stilts fragmenting itself. Seemingly organic, the village breaks away from it holding pillars in an attempt to change position, to migrate. This project explores the idea of a flexible habitat able to stretch, to bounce back into shape and shift its orientation easily as if gravity was no issue.	\N	1	0	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Installation, wood, nylon, concrete	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Forlane 6 Studio: Hortense Le Calvez & Mathieu Goussin	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	{2000,1334}	https://forlane6studio.com/portfolio/autotomy2016/	\N	01070000A0E6100000010000000101000080973B33C1707237405E0EBBEF18AC42400000000000000000	t	\N

The film reveals various processes in the water that are hidden to the naked human eye. By investigating the brackish water, its inhabitants, its properties, and the traces left by human activities, the film is a reflection upon the relationship we humans have with our surroundings, especially through what we cannot see.	\N	1	0	1	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Marjolijn Dijkman and Toril Johannessen	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	{3000,1687}	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/10	\N	\N	t	\N

The performance took place within the registration of a gridded carpet that acted as a guide for the choreography. Comte is interested in the way one might interpret non-human movement as an empathic attempt to grasp or embody another being.	\N	1	0	1	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Performance	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Claudia Comte and TBA21–Academy	\N	\N	814	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/2	\N	\N	t	\N

The performance combines a selection of existing literature, poetry, historical recollections, personal memories, materials from in and around the ocean, as well as manufactured soundscapes that evoke memories of songs by the sea. In this work, Kukama addresses the need for a sensory language that imagines and articulates ways in which the past, present, and future could co-exist fluidly.	\N	1	0	0	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Performance	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Donna Kukama and TBA21–Academy	\N	\N	1903	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/2	\N	\N	t	\N

The ancient natural phenomena, the old magic and weapon against the colonial oppressor in some indigenous cultures, is now an alarm system for the future of an ecosystem in peril. The project is prototype building and aims to counter balance environmental violence with conservation and artistic means for non-humans and humans. Planetary sensing aims for a biosphere protection application to UNESCO as an umbrella for the ecosystem of Oyster Bay in Jamaica. With this specific habitat of bioluminescent dinoflagellates as a starting point, a scientific research and learning hub, biosensors and citizen science in a multispecies world are some of the other nodal goals. As an art installation, 'Planetary sensing' will refract the interrelationships that creates bioluminescence, a phenomenon found in various bays in the Caribbean. It experiments with an ethical principle for natural rights that disregards the distinction between living and non-living matter.	\N	1	0	1	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	artistic research project	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Susanne M.

The journey set the space to feel and think differently about the oceans, springing from the urge to reunite thinkers and artists to start a new school of sensing intelligence while exploring the questions: Is the Ocean an art space? Or a future space within the arts? How many waves are in the Ocean?

On the one hand, life, like the whale in the film, is dying because of pollution. On the other, people of the ocean – like the Maori community featured in this film – have agency in turning these tragedies into cultural life, finding a way of moving forward by honouring the dead and campaigning for a better political future.\n\nThe death of the whale leads people in the small village of Muriwai that it beached in to relearn the customary ways of removing her bones and curing them to make Taonga – cultural treasures – that in turn tell the history of their relationships. While her flesh is too toxic to be consumed as it was when the Pacific Ocean was cleaner, her soft bones can be used to fertilize Kauri trees that are dying. The whale thereby lives on in the healthy trees and carvings on the tribal meeting house, which keeps oral histories alive in contemporary art.\n\nThe video was made with the Rangiwaho community in Aotearoa/New Zealand during a time when their material culture was returned to them for the first time after being looted in the scientific raid of Captain Cook in 1769. It is in the context of this political agency that the whale is a sign, that from the tragic legacy of colonialism, new Taonga can be made. This is part of healing the colonial wound, and it is the wounds deep on Te Haa Kui o Tangaroa’s body that the viewer witnesses as Jody Toroa tells her story.	\N	1	1	0	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Ocean Space, Church of San Lorenzo, Venice, Italy	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Khadija von Zinnenburg Carroll and TBA21–Academy	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	{1280,720}	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/14	\N	\N	t	\N

The journey set the space to feel and think differently about the oceans, springing from the urge to reunite thinkers and artists to start a new school of sensing intelligence while exploring the questions: Is the Ocean an art space?

These giant circular ocean currents collect and contain plastic from around the world. Plastic Reef grew in size parallel to the increasing exposure and awareness that was slowly awakening. Every time the work was exhibited it became bigger as more and more plastic was added. In total more than 1000kg of plastic debris was fished out between 2008 and 2013.

She points out that even if we cannot live together in a non-hierarchical way, because we are different animals, we can still speak of other animals in a way that maintains their individuality and that sees nature as something we have in common. \n\nThe wildly living, in which we recognize our own wild nature, that which transcends and soaks the human in us and puts us in an »already there« relation to other animals. In order to grasp the relationship between human and animal, we have to enquire from below, from what we have in common, the animalistic.	\N	1	0	0	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Solveig Bøe / The Wild Living Marine Resources Belong to Society as a Whole	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/18	\N	\N	t	\N

Winterling’s residency at the TBA21 Alligator Head Foundation in Jamaica. The work investigates the bioluminescence of dinoflagellate algae as indicators for the health of coastal waters with toxic potential. For several years, Winterling’s research has homed in on these organic bodies that light up when touched or moved, reminiscent of the touchscreens that surround us these days. As ancient cultures have long known (and science is only just beginning to discover) these tiny creatures behave like living indicators of the ecological health – communicating urgent status updates on the composition of the waters they inhabit by ‘blooming’ in response to unusually high temperatures or concentrations of pollutants. \n\nThis image is a still from the video interview that makes up part of the intermedia installation with the Rock-based fisherman Gerry who grants insight into the medicinal properties of algae for treating skin infections, known to locals for centuries. 'Glistening troubles' places the skin (our outer boundaries, with which we touch our surroundings) and luminescent screen technologies (our interfaces to digital realities) in metaphorical proximity. Winterling’s research delves into the overlapping information in analogue and virtual worlds as well as into interspecies solidarity and points to our vibrant entanglement with other bodies.\n\nThe work was co-commissioned by Contour Biennale 8, Thyssen-Bornemisza Art Contemporary–Academy, Alligator Head Foundation TBA21–Residency, Henie Onstad Kunstsenter (HOK), and the Institute of Contemporary Art, University of Pennsylvania with additional support by the Research Fund of Oslo National Academy of the Arts.	\N	1	0	1	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Mixed media installation and CGI	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Susanne M.

Episode 2: Deep Frontiers	\N	\N	Written by anthropologist Stefan Helmreich, 'What is Deep Sea Mining? Episode 2: Deep Frontiers' is a brief history about knowledge of the deep sea and its resources. It highlights the ambiguity of this history, as depictions of the deep changed throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Today, this knowledge informs discussions about the commercialization of biological and geological resources, with the deep sea fast becoming a zone of international dispute, opening up a debate about sustainable practices at sea.\n\n'What is Deep Sea Mining?' is a TBA21–Academy commission developed by Inhabitants (Mariana Silva and Pedro Neves Marques), an online channel for exploratory video and documentary reporting, in collaboration with Margarida Mendes, curator and activist from Lisbon, Portugal, and founding member of Oceano Livre environmental movement against deep sea mining.	\N	1	0	1	\N	\N	EN	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	t	\N	\N	\N	\N	Courtesy of Inhabitants and TBA21–Academy	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	https://ocean-archive.org/collection/19	\N	\N	t	\N
